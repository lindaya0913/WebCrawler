      "['Overall:\\xa0I have been using Zoom for a long time now. But before the Covid-19 pandemic, I was not a regular user of Zoom. But during the lockdown, while working from home, it became my best friend. Also, it got better day by day. I am happy that the developers are working very hard to push regular updates. The desktop app and mobile app both are quite useful. The mobile app is a great way to catch up with meetings while I am on a run. Although I am currently using the free plan now, I will certainly buy a premium plan very soon.', \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom is undoubtedly the best meeting software out there. It's not only because of its features but also for the usability of this tool. The user interface of Zoom is a bit traditional while the competitors are using a bit more modern approach. But this is where things have become interesting. Because of the legacy UI of this tool, the users find it very easy to get started with this app. When I first started using Zoom, it took only an hour to get familiar with all the features. Another useful feature of Zoom is the ability to annotate on the screen. Also, the screen sharing tool is quite handy and it has a lot of functionalities. Oh, I forgot to tell you about the amazing virtual backgrounds. Frankly speaking, this is one of the most useful features and I can attend any formal meeting even from my garage using this feature.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Zoom certainly offers a nice free plan with many features. But I don't really like the time limit thing in the free version. Rather they could have just restricted a few features from here and there. It would help many people who can't afford self-hosting zoom or buying a premium plan. But I must admit that the paid plan is not that expensive.\", \"Reasons for Choosing Zoom Meetings:\\xa0While looking for the best video conferencing tool some people suggested Jitsi Meet to me. But while researching for a while I found that Jitsi Meet is not as convenient as Zoom. Also, most of my clients are familiar with Zoom and they won't want to switch to a different platform. Considering all these factors, I had to choose Zoom over it.\", 'Switched From:\\xa0Google Meet', \"Reasons for Switching to Zoom Meetings:\\xa0While the UI of Google Meet is very simple and intuitive, it lacks some advanced features. It doesn't even have a desktop app. Also, I have a plan to scale my company and then I will use a self-hosted Zoom environment. Google Meet doesn't offer me this functionality. For these obvious reasons, I had to switch from Google Meet.\"]\n",

      "[\"Pros:\\xa0There are lots of things that are helpful about Zoom, especially during a time when working from home was required. The biggest takeaway for me was how helpful Zoom is for my ADHD. I have always had a really hard time paying attention to someone over the phone, so working from home was daunting. But I have found that if I can look at someone's face while they are talking, I don't get as distracted -- even if we aren't in the same room together. Having virtual meetings be a more normalized option has made me better at my job, and Zoom has made it easier for everyone to have access to video chat services -- on their computer or on their phone. Zoom has made it easier for me to build and maintain relationships in my personal and professional life, regardless of if someone has an android or iphone. I'm more productive during meetings and am able to retain more details about the conversation. Zoom is also superior in this way because of where I can move the windows around. So I can move people's faces in the order that is the most productive for me (like who is talking vs everyone at once, etc). \", \"Cons:\\xa0There are too many clicks needed to do anything. When I log in, I wish I could schedule a meeting without having to click into my account page. When I want to change my virtual background, I wish I didn't have to take 3-5 clicks to do that. \", 'Switched From:\\xa0Google Hangouts', \"Reasons for Switching to Zoom Meetings:\\xa0Video quality is better in zoom, and Google Hangouts didn't translate as well across user experiences, like it was better for people with a gmail account vs outlook. \"]\n",

      "['Overall:\\xa0Zoom Meetings was our answer to the reduced in-person contact from COVID-19. Many of the changes we made to survive the pandemic involved using strategies that were designed for other functions, with the hope that they would be adequate enough to fulfill our short term needs before we could return to business as usual. Zoom Meetings did not fit into this category. It provided us with the ability to recreate our conference room meetings without requiring our staff to coordinate their schedules and travel significant distances to attend in-person weekly meetings, and using Zoom Meetings did not decrease the quality of the actual meetings. When we realized that we could maintain the quality of our meetings without having to incur the costs of employees traveling to a central site--as well as the lost productivity that resulted from this travel time--we made a permanent shift to Zoom Meetings. Our meetings and collaborations were necessary, but we did not appreciate how disruptive they were to our operations until we implemented Zoom Meetings. The amount of money we save in two weeks from hosting virtual meetings more than covers the annual cost of our Zoom subscription. Most importantly, this reduction in cost does not come at the expense of the quality of our staff meetings. Instead, it has actually increased our ability to collaborate because we are able to provide our staff at various locations with the ability to meet with their counterparts more frequently. ', 'Pros:\\xa0Zoom Meetings has allowed us to hold weekly and \"on-demand\" staff meetings with the employees spread out across multiple locations in a way that recreates the atmosphere of the staff meetings pre-pandemic. Unlike some of the solutions we used during COVID-19, staff meetings through Zoom Meetings became a permanent addition to our business schedule. While it is unlikely we ever would have switched from in-person to virtual had the pandemic not forced us to, our adoption of Zoom Meetings not only let us continue operations but it paid dividends in gained productivity and reduced costs, which has led to us deciding to continue its use indefinitely. Being able to host the entirety of our staff in a meeting without incurring travel costs and lost time has been a significant improvement for our operations, and the cost of Zoom Meetings is minuscule  compared to the money we save. ', 'Cons:\\xa0The limitations on the number of administrators that can host a meeting without increasing the pricing is an inconvenience. Because we use Zoom Meetings for site-wide meetings as well as department-specific meetings, the requirement that only one user can act as the initial host forces our director to start all meetings. He can then transfer the host role to the employee presiding over the meeting, but the need to have him set up and initiate every meeting can be frustrating. We have no issues with being limited to only hosting one meeting at any given time, but we would like to be able to set the meeting host prior to the start of it. ']\n",

I used to provide online services of youtube watch time and youtube SEO, but some customers ask for a live demo first. And for that, I use to schedule a meeting with my client firstly on zoom. And on the live meeting, I will clear him each and everything through my screen share, and in return, he will offer me a good budget.\\nNow if you also want to manage your business online or want to schedule an online meeting with your clients or want an online meetup with your youtube audience then definitely no platform is better than zoom. just download it free from Capterra and start enjoying a good life with zoom.\", \"Pros:\\xa0I liked the private chat and screen recording during the live meetings, too much.\\nNo matter has many participants have been joined, I can always chat with anyone privately.\\nI can also send my message to all participants at once by going into the live chat tab.

But with the use of zoom, I can ask as many questions as they appear in my mind.\\nAnd the second thing, why I liked the screen recording feature of zoom too much? The answer is so simple, I don't want to lose my client's trust and I also don't want to waste my own time. Because I can't offer tutorials to my clients, again and again, That is why I use to record my computer screen and upload screen recording on google drive and on dropbox.

The reason behind this one is, this thing wastes a lot of time to upload a video manually on google drive and on youtube. But I have to upload these recording videos on youtube because I can't store such long data on my personal computer.\\nThat's why I wish there should be an option of linking youtube and google drive or dropbox.

What makes zoom so great is how portable it is.

It makes collaborating easier with colleagues or clients with features like a share-screen and remote access. \\n\\nWe would face many problems without Zoom in today's COVID- 19 environment unless we were able to provide clients and colleagues with simple ways to communicate. Having the ability to send a link and jump into a quick call is very convenient and useful.

Unless your business involves wrenches or blowtorches, odds are high you\\'ve even used it in the last year. If you haven\\'t formed an opinion by now, then maybe Zoom isn\\'t for you. But even if you have no need for it in your work life, there\\'s no reason not to implement it into your personal life. What better way to catch up with your Facebook friends than on Zoom? Signed up for a dating service? Use Zoom. Need to discuss a legal matter as an animated cat? Zoom! With Zoom, there\\'s no reason to remain out of touch, as long as you don\\'t have to touch anything. I mean, it\\'s still limited to screens and digital representations. Not the best way to give someone a hug. But after a year of social distancing, are hugs even still allowed? Might have to ask that animated cat for advice on that matter. But hugs aside, Zoom is the perfect way to talk to someone when you can\\'t be there in person. And if you don\\'t want to talk? There\\'s a convenient button that turns off your camera and microphone. \"Technical difficulties! I can\\'t hear-\"And he\\'s gone. Zoom!', \"Pros:\\xa0Everyone uses it, so if you're having trouble getting started, it takes no effort to troubleshoot it. It's also perfect for free communication, as long as you're not hosting a group chat (more than two participants). If you're the host of a group chat, you'll need to either watch the clock or your wallet, but even then it's affordable, especially if you're using it for business. It might be less profitable to pay for a service to host a chat where no one is earning for the team, but Zoom still lets you have that group meeting (sometimes for free if you keep the session short enough), and if you happen to be conducting the kind of business that leads to profits, then the cost of that meeting shouldn't matter. Finally, it's really easy to connect to a meeting, and almost as easy to host one. Most of the time, it's just a matter of copy and pasting a link and clicking on it. But even if you have to sign as yourself or the member of an organization, it doesn't take much effort to get going. Just make sure your camera and microphone work. It's only as good as the equipment you use.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Other than the background effects being average at best, I don't have much criticisms against Zoom. It can sometimes be difficult to customize your view port, and scanning participants for the active speaker can be a challenge if your setup is confused. And screen sharing can get awkward when you have too many windows to choose from, or if your share space is too nested within a framework of open windows. But most of these issues are easy to overcome once you get familiar with the system. Like Google's technology suite, it's only as overwhelming as the first time you use it.

This eats up precious time throughout the day closing/opening etc. There is also no ability to close just one room. I also can't save room titles from day to day which again eats up time when I am making the same four rooms for Reader's Workshop and Math Workshop every day. I could keep going as this software is just not meant to be used while supervising children so many of the functions needed are missing. \"]\n",

It allows a host of actions and provides a myraid of controls for the user/account holder.  As a teacher, it allows lots of controls for classroom purposes such as control of the chat function, and control of almost all user functions after meeting has started.  Of course, within the preferences, you can control much more of the meeting and its users prior to the meeting/session  starting.  It has become a welcome addtion for distance learning.  ', 'Cons:\\xa0The two primary complaints have to do with the toolbar to do things like annotating a screen/document when sharing a screen or using the whiteboard function.  One part of that function makes some sense given what technical aspects.  You are basically layering something on top of a document, so if you move the document around on the screen the annotations DO NOT move with the document.  This is frustrating but understandable. Also, you have to close out the annotating toolbar to do other things instead of just being able to click on a different part of the Zoom session screen to perform that function.  By that I mean, WHen the annotate toolbar is open you cannot perform any other functions in Zoom until you close the toolbar function.  That is the frustrating part for this user.  My last complaint is more of a minor one at the account management level.  When adding alternative hosts as we often do for our district for substitute teachers, administrators, etc, you can just add to an ever-growing list.  You have to completely re-enter the ENTIRE list.  Our District IT team has repeatedly told us this is a Zoom issue, not anything they can control/improve on the District management end.

You can create breakout rooms where you split teams to do the job in pairs for example or you can even organize a public webinar that can attend multiple thousand people with no problem or lag.\\nI remember times when we tried another video conferencing tool and it was an awful experience a few years ago.

It features a free plan but you can have conferences of only 40 mins and with a limited number of participants. Also, sometimes recorded sessions take a long to encode on a local computer but maybe is that because of a little older hardware in my current PC I use Zoom with. I miss the feature to trim cloud recording. Sometimes I or my colleagues start recording a little too early and if they chose cloud recording there is no cloud trim function and then we have to download the replay and trim it manually and then upload it to some other service.

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0Overall Zoom is an amazing software and I'm glad that most teachers use it. I do think there are some improvements and some added features to be made. Zoom's a strong option for anyone needing to teach a class through the internet or host online meetings with international people and I believe it will become a better feature as time moves on.\", \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom has been a great software for online meetings since 2013. Although only a couple of people had used Zoom pre-2020, it started to emerge during the time Covid-19 started affecting schools. Due to people having social distance, having school in-person was essentially impossible without getting sick. Zoom was a strong solution to this problem and is still being used more than ever today. Like most students, I have been only using Zoom as a way to attend school during this pandemic but I do not mind having online school especially since I know doing it may save my peers from contracting the virus. Zoom has provided a way for us students to attend school without having the risk of exposing or being exposed to Covid-19. Zoom's software is easily manageable as most people in my family could use it without issue. It's video chat software allows for the option to quickly turn on or off both your mic and camera in an instant. You can also message people through a chat during a meeting so there's no need to turn on your mic to ask a question. The quick command menu allows you to ask your teacher multiple things without having to get their attention while they're teaching. Accessing a Zoom meeting is also very simple as you can send or receive a link that will instantly put you into the meeting or enter the room code. Zoom has a feature where the host can send you into separate groups privately which is very effective when doing group projects.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Zoom has some flaws that other softwares already have integrated into their system. One example is Discord which allows the user to turn up the mic volume of anyone in a meeting while allowing you to simultaneously turn down the mic of someone else. Zoom does have to ability to allow you to add contacts but personally I don't use this feature because there's not a quicker way to do other than adding their email address. I think this takes too long and so, therefore, don't use this feature as much. Zoom seems to be strictly a video, call, and message application when many of its users are students and teachers. Integrating a feature that allows teachers to hand out assignments in an organized way would seem more beneficial. Also, it does seem like Zoom could add more features to make it seems like an software that's used more for than just school and work. It could add a social media feature, although this is a hypothetical situation, similar to Snapchat's ability to send pictures to anyone in an instant. Or add a stories feature where teachers can remind students that an assignment may be due while making it look more interesting than just an email notification on your phone.\", 'Switched From:\\xa0Google Meet', \"Reasons for Switching to Zoom Meetings:\\xa0Well I personallly didn't make the switch but my teachers did. I believe it's because they figured that since most other teachers use Zoom, they wouldn't want to confuse their students by having them use more than two software for online school.\"]\n",

As the project manager on implementing and researching a viable solution, we looked at what we had, and what we wanted. We had GoToMeeting. I found that this product was clunky, not user friendly, and overall a hassle to implement and utilize for a wide demographic of members. Zoom to the rescue!

I can send a meeting to multiple people quickly and easily, with it being easy and simple on their end. The feedback has been nothing but positive. Secondly, I love the stable connection zoom provides, with crystal-clear audio and video when we run a meeting with over 200 people at once. This was spot on for what we were looking for. ', 'Cons:\\xa0My only issue with Zoom is during rapid discussion. Sometimes the software has an issue keeping up, audio will cut out, and it is sometimes difficult to follow when multiple people are talking at once.

      "Title:  “Modern Meetings Made Easy!”\n",
      "[\"Overall:\\xa0Overall, Zoom Meetings & Chat has become a great way to get work done in a simple manner. Everyone is online now, and in person conferences are outdated. Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.\\n\\nI have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too. \\n\\nI will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while.\", \"Pros:\\xa0This is a great time to use modern software like Zoom Meetings & Chat for video conference and meetings. I will try to go over all the features which I believe makes this software customizable. \\n\\nYou can use it either through a desktop, ipad or tablet, as well as your cell phone. The cellphone or other tablets may have limited features though. The thing I like the most about Zoom is being able to schedule several meeting, invite individual members to the meeting,  either through a meeting ID number and password (optional) or a specific URL as an easy access link. I believe all invited need to have the software downloaded AND create a login.   For training purposes, you can easily show your screen to your meeting members, so if they have a hard time accessing or understanding the information given to them, you can show them step by step. The host can also screen record the meeting to share with someone that wasn't available to attend the meeting. The host is the only one who can all members at once and individually mute/unmute. Everyone has the option of seeing a gallery of members on one screen or one person at a time (generally whoever is speaking). Lastly, there is a chat option included, but if you're on a tablet or phone you can't access the chat and see members at the same time. The chat is good to share links or information shared that you want members to access.  Sorry about the list but they really have SO MANY OPTIONS.\", \"Cons:\\xa0The host MUST have a strong internet capability otherwise there may be some lagging so keep that in mind. Also, members that are accessing the meeting over a phone or tablet may have a limited amount of features, so I highly recommend a desktop (with camera) and hard internet wired for a more professional approach. I do believe they have currently waived the 40 minute max for meetings, but generally, I think  you have to pay extra to have meetings longer than 40 minutes. This is not usually a problem, unless you have a very long meeting.\\n\\nMeeting Security/Safety is another issue. I would HIGHLY suggest not sharing URL links online. ONLY SHARE URLS OR MEETING IDS DIRECTLY WITH WHO YOU WANT TO ATTEND, AND HAVE IT PASSWORD PROTECTED. If your meeting isn't password protected, it may be likely that anyone could access your meeting. The last thing you want is a stranger jumping into your meeting and roaming free on what they say or show. There are people like that out there, so save yourself the trouble. \"]\n"

      "['Overall:\\xa0Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes.', 'Pros:\\xa0There are *so* many features that are amazingly effective for language learning in a virtual classroom. Besides the expected (and helpful) virtual whiteboard and screen sharing available to both me as the teacher and other users as students, there are also Breakout Rooms. This is essential for learning any foreign language; the Breakout Rooms simulate partnered or smaller group activities that are necessary for practicing the target language in context with another learner. These allow students to speak one-on-one (or in small groups) with each other for a brief exercise before returning to the Main Room of the video chat. The teacher can also check in on each of the private Breakout Rooms to make sure everything is running smoothly, and if a student requires immediate help, there is another button within a Breakout Room to let the teacher know. Lastly, one feature that I have not found in other video chat software such as Skype or Google Hangouts is the virtual hand-raising button. This prevents users from speaking over each other, and the host/teacher can immediately tell which student would like to ask a question. ', \"Cons:\\xa0I think almost everything could potentially be improved... It is always harder to conduct a meeting virtually than in real life, especially when that meeting is a *language lesson.* It is the first stages, however, so I and my students will have to adapt over the next few weeks. That said, I am a little frustrated that the host/teacher cannot share a screen view or a whiteboard during the Breakout Rooms. This forces students to share their own screens with each other, and/or have other apps open at the same time. I would like for them to be able to access my lesson slides during their small group/partnered activities, but this doesn't seem to be possible yet with Zoom. \"]\n",

You can change sound and video outputs straight from the software.\\n\\nZoom is the best video conference software I have ever used.', \"Cons:\\xa0In sharing mode, the controls are stripped down and do not have text on the icons, so it can be difficult to know what they do. This goes away when you use the software every day and learn what the icons do, but this learning curve is steeper than it needs to be. The chat design it decent and doesn't cover the shared screen, like bluejeans does. However, it is just a simple chat and there could be more integrations here.

I was able to be present for staff meetings, have regular meetings with my boss(es) to discuss tasks & meet with other staff when needed to coordinate projects or train others. It was instrumental in allowing me to work from home and still stay connected to the team and on the right path with my tasks!

I also love that I can hit the downsize button on the Zoom screen and it will become a small icon on the screen that still streams the video and allows me to see who is talking, but it frees up my screen to multitask. Zoom is also flexible - meetings can be scheduled in advance or on the fly and shared with others. It's easy to share the meeting with others, and the program itself is easy to use!

However, it's not a true screen share - you're only sharing one item (an open file, document, or website, etc). If you move to a different item on your computer it does update the screen for the other participants. Only the file/website/doc that you originally picked will show to the other users. At times that set up is perfect and allows you to look at other things on your computer without disrupting the meeting. However, I wish there were an option to have the screen share update based on what the sharer is looking at. At times I have a number of things I need to show the other participants, and it becomes tedious to have to close the screen share and re-open it whenever I want to change what I'm showing the participants.\"]\n",

I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing.\", \"Pros:\\xa0It's honestly very easy to use. Even our clients who don't necessarily have Zoom downloaded prior to a Zoom Meeting find it easy to get up and running which really takes the burden off of us and relieves any back and forth having to explain how to work the program during time that should be spent already on a call. The functionality of the software does not change very much between the free version and the more premium versions which I appreciated; the paid version really only seems to remove the restrictions of the free version so it didn't feel like having to learn a brand new program once we made the switch. Everything is labeled fairly clearly, and I didn't have to research the software extensively to find out how to work each function because of how user-friendly it is. The options to use your computer audio or call in by phone really makes it shine I think though, as most video conferencing software does not provide the either/or option, which I think anyone who has been in a video conference will know only leads to lackluster audio quality. \", 'Cons:\\xa0I think if Zoom created a handbook or user guide that they sent to each person or business who purchases their software, it would really put them above the rest. The software is user-friendly, but I did have to google a few things to figure out how to work certain elements of the software. I understand the reasoning behind defaulting every call to password protected, but I think it should be optional, as there are already a lot of numbers involved in accessing a call and throwing in a password has confused more than one of my meeting participants. The invitation to each zoom meeting I think is also a little unclear, when you first start using the program it is an overwhelming amount of information to have put in front of you and with the addition of multiple phone numbers by time zone and two different links it can be difficult to puzzle out. If it was a little more clearly defined I think it would be perfect, I know I had to trial and error myself before figuring out how to do it right every time.

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0My experience with this software has been reliable when excluding certain behaviors, such as moving Zoom windows around when recording or using the annotation tool. I haven't got the chance to use frequently this software on other devices, but I have mixed feelings when using it on a Linux system because of the aforementioned issues. I find Zoom is a solid option for one-on-one meetings, particularly considering everything needed works perfectly on a free plan. For bigger meetings, a Premium plan is a must and one can still benefit a lot from this software. It has enabled me to do screen sharing very easily without having to know anything about video recording or editing. Even on low-end PCs, I feel that Zoom is quite capable of rendering a good enough video for formal meetings that need to be shared later by other means. The encoding used for exported videos is a great compromise between size and quality, making it a viable option when it comes to sharing a meeting online. I wouldn't recommend Zoom for producing high-quality videos intended for commercial use or for presentations with a large audience (above 100 participants), but it works perfectly fine for personal projects and for most business meetings. I find I could benefit more if I were able to use all the available features as one often needs to rely on workarounds such as using an image editing tool to make drawings from screenshots instead of being able to directly work on the screen as intended by the software.\", \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom brings to the table premium features for free. One-on-one meetings are not time-limited or missing any essential option. It is possible to set up recurring meetings by generating a permanent Zoom link, which is very useful to have custom links for many different contacts. Zoom makes it possible to share the screen with others: either to record a solo session; screen share with others in a meeting while having the ability to record audio and video; share only a specific window or the entire desktop and there's also a quick way to switch between different screens from participants, all of it being configurable in the application. Scheduling a new meeting is straightforward and numerous options are presented to make it easy to obtain the desired behavior by default when launching a meeting. Meetings can also be integrated with external calendars and provide more advanced options to facilitate interactions when the meeting starts, such as automatically recording on the local computer and asking for a password to prevent unauthorized access. Being able to chat with attendees and store all relevant information about them in an address book inside Zoom are other features that make interactions with frequent users a breeze. There are plenty of settings available from the main window to adjust audio, video and recording details and even integration with dual monitors.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Technical issues are present with the Linux desktop application in certain hardware conditions, especially with the annotation tool, rendering it totally useless. While using that tool, the screen isn't updated in real-time and won't allow displaying drawings with a transparent background to make it possible to annotate on the screen while keeping the desktop visible in the background. There are also various notable glitches when moving Zoom windows around, such as the video window being duplicated when recording and staying on the screen for extended periods of time, ruining the quality of any recording being made. Because of those shortcomings, it is impractical to try and move the windows when recording and some features simply need to be forgotten at those times. It is also inconvenient that the toolbar won't display properly when set at the bottom of the screen, as it only opens from top to bottom, making the list of tools go outside the bottom part of the screen and effectively unreachable. There is no way to resize the toolbar which occupies too much space on tiny monitors (screen size of 13 inches and below). In a similar fashion, the main window when a meeting is happening can't easily be resized as some buttons will disappear and become unusable, making it harder to record the session or end the meeting.\"]\n",

      "[\"Pros:\\xa0Affordable. Reliable. Easy. That's Zoom in a nutshell. We have experienced the heartache of running a webinar only to have the audio cut in and out and glitch the entire time - ultimately causing our attendees to drop off. But, that's not the case with Zoom. Our company, belonging to the industry of software QA and testing, regularly hosts remote meetings to check in and collaborate on progress and future team initiatives. We decided to make the switch from GoToMeeting (a great alternative to Zoom) because it fit our needs more accurately. Zooms customer support is remarkably responsive and very quick to solve any issues encountered.\\n\\nPros\\nZoom video conference calling and webinar is fitting for any sized company or organization. Meetings can be scheduled within seconds and added directly from Zoom's platform to Google Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, or Outlook Calendar; which allows you to set up invites and add additional attendees.\\n\\nZoom provides the option to either enroll in a monthly or an annual plan, in which you can choose to deactivate and/or reactivate at any time (beneficial for saving extra bucks if you do not run regular monthly webinars). The plan that includes 100 participants, for both video conferencing and webinar, are priced at an affordable price per month (GoToWebinar is nearly double in price for the same plan). \\n\\nThe audio on calls and webinars comes across crisp; we have never experienced any issues with dropped calls or glitches during webinars). \\n\\nHaving the ability to join calls and webinars from any desktop, tablet, and/or phone (iOS and android) is convenient for anyone looking to access meetings on the go. Zoom includes various features, i.e. live screen-sharing, whiteboard, etc., which helps relieve the difficulties of working remotely.  \\n\\nIf you are holding an international meeting, I.e. training, trainees can join by laptop and listen over laptop speakers (they would have to use laptop and not call in directly via phone to avoid having to pay for extra international call credits - which costs an additional /month). \\nZoom comes in handy when working with distributed teams; Zoom's conference calling features are great for doing demos, exercises, sprint planning, etc.\", \"Cons:\\xa0When joining a webinar or a call via mobile device, it's unclear how to join audio (I thought there was something wrong with my phone because it was telling me my audio was on but I could not hear anything during the webinar - turns out I couldn't see the audio number which was hidden behind the webinar). If anyone else has this confusion you can also look at the original webinar confirmation or follow-up reminder and locate the call-in number there. \\n\\nThe poll questions and results to not display in the webinar recordings so you will have to edit or takes screenshots and merge them into your recording (we use I movie to do this).\"]\n",

I actually have the invitation already pasted into my appointment confirmation and reminder autoresponder, with the url and dial-in information. It's so easy to manage appointments this way. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe recording feature is helpful as well. When your session is over, the recording is available in different formats, video and audio, and gets automatically processes and stored in your computer and available to upload to my clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like the video conferencing feature for groups as well, with different screen possibilities. I can choose to view everyone at once, only a few people at once, or the speaker. This is helpful for webinars and group coaching. \\r\\n\\r\\nShare screen is a feature I use in different ways. For client enrollment conversations. I can actually share the Agreement form and go through all of the contract terms in real time, being able to close the sale more quickly. In client sessions I can go through their website or materials and give real-time feedback, which is invaluable. \\r\\n\\r\\nChat feature makes workshops, webinars and group sessions engaging and lively.

It's also valuable if you host a meeting and want to invite others outside of your organization without having to fly them to your city to meet in person. My experience with Zoom falls into this latter category. That is to say, my Zoom is experience is based on being in invitee to meetings hosted by other organizations that use Zoom. There are several features I like about Zoom. The audio quality is great as is the video quality. It's fairly easy to join a Zoom meeting (once you have the meeting credentials you simply click out on the url provided by the organizer). For audio, you can dial in or use your computer's audio system. \", \"Cons:\\xa0As an infrequent user of Zoom, I find it to be less easy to use than GotoMeeting (which is what my company uses). The Zoom interface is less clear, and it's not quite as easy to see who is in the meeting (whereas with GotoMeeting both of these details are quite obvious because of the helpful dashboard). With Zoom, I often find myself clicking around to figure out how things work. In sum, it's less user-friendly than other digital meeting applications I've used.\"]\n",

From the host point of view, it is easy to access all of its features.

We use this software as part of our Distance Learning programs. And we've used it with schools, museums, and hospitals. Think kids that are sick and cannot leave the hospital. Or kids from a landlocked state, who haven't seen the ocean. We take them on virtual tours of our Aquarium, and show them the bay and the shipping channel, and it's all LIVE VIDEO and two way communication so we can answer questions and show the kids what they want to see.  This software is so easy to use, not just for our staff, but also for educators and hospital staff. It's extremely easy for them to click a link and know the software will work without their having to call their IT staff to install software and test it over and over again.  We have not had any problems whatsoever with connecting to Zoom or during our meetings that weren't related to our internet or end user's internet connection.\", \"Cons:\\xa0I'm hard pressed to pinpoint what I like least about this software.

Jumping directly into working remote in 2020, it was important to have constant contact with our office and Zoom Meetings provided our office with this.', 'Pros:\\xa0My most favorite aspect of Zoom is the ease of use. We started with using Teams as a method of conferencing when the pandemic began and immediately jumped into Zoom with no training. The steps to launch Zoom was very easy and all of my team was able to jump on board with Zoom with no problem at all.  The quality of the audio and video is great, and is above all other conferencing methods our office has used in the past.  The recording feature has been a life-saver when having office wide trainings.  Both joining and creating a meeting is simple and requires no training to get started quickly on a Zoom meeting.', 'Cons:\\xa0As a user, I have not experienced anything negative with Zoom Meetings.

Not only has Zoom really made an effort to deliver a platform that works, but they have also put a lot of thought into how virtual meetings can be a chance to have some fun and bond. We've been able to host team bonding events on Zoom (eg. Murder Mystery Parties) and that would not have been possible without its features!\", \"Pros:\\xa0After COVID began and my company moved online, we relied on Zoom daily to stay connected to our team and our clients. The quality of the call is unparalleled (at least in comparison to other similar software I've used, including Microsoft teams, Skype, Google Hangouts, Discord). It's easy to use and doesn't require the other use to install the Zoom app. It works well on mobile devices as well, meaning I can take my calls to-go easily. I love how polling can be incorporated into meetings as well and I love the reactions that we can use. The recent update with filters also adds a fun element to our meetings. Lastly, I love the ability to record our meetings directly to the cloud.   \", \"Cons:\\xa0The only complaint I have at the moment is that I'm unable to use Zoom virtual backgrounds. I've updated my computer and ensured that all the specs supports this feature. However, it appears that Zoom is not recognizing my face as a face and believes that I am part of the wall; all that are left are my eyes.

The Zoom meeting allows us to exchange the control of sharing the screen and the best feature I like is we can give each other the control of mouse and keyboard as well for each others screen.

For example, my room has a number, that is, if someone enters that ID on the platform, it would be connected to my room.\\n\\nNow, other things that I like about the application is the notification that is sent when someone tries to enter your room, before you have opened it.\\n\\nI choose between Zoom and Skype, I would choose Zoom a thousand times.', 'Cons:\\xa0Like any application, there is a paid version and a free version.\\n\\nThe only bad thing about having the free version is that you have a limit of 40 minutes each time you open your room. That is to say that if your presentation lasts 1 hour, after 40 minutes it will close and you will have to reopen it to finish the presentation.\\n\\nSo if you need more than 40 minutes to use your room I blindly recommend that you pay for the premium version.

It makes meetings more productive, where more people can work on multiple things simultaneously without leaving the meeting. \", \"Cons:\\xa0The only issue I have is the bandwidth it uses when using both audio and video features, because it weighs down the connection sometimes when we're Zooming with some of our locations in other islands. Our internet connectivity is spotty in some areas and is made worse when bandwidth limits are reached. However, I don't think that's an issue with Zoom, rather internet connectivity, but if there could be a way to minimize bandwidth usage when turning on video features, that would help in more remote areas with limited internet connectivity. \"]\n",

Moving forward, we have decided to maintain our virtual meetings indefinitely, because our board has discovered that Zoom leads to more productivity, more frequent meetings, and less cost to the organization due to no longer needing to cover travel, lodging, and meal expenses. \", 'Cons:\\xa0The only drawback for us is that the lowest pricing tier above free contains significantly more options than we require. That being said, we would be willing to pay much more than we currently do due to the vast savings we have realized by eliminating a significant line item in our budget by not having members travel to in person meetings. ', 'Reasons for Choosing Zoom Meetings:\\xa0Zoom gave us the feeling of being in a board meeting. Skype has worked wonders for us in the past when we needed to virtually include a single board member who was unable to travel, but Zoom is superior in our view when it comes to hosting an entirely virtual meeting.

Polling can be used to get participants to engage throughout the session. It can be used for games, to get responses from attendees or get a as pulse on how participants are feeling about the session. Also, the whiteboard allows the host to write or draw, and can even allow participants to add content as well. The whiteboard can be saved do that people can refer to it again later.  There's also an option to allow participants to join ahead of time, or to have them wait until the host admits them into the room.

The second slight annoyance with Zoom is that it automatically blocks the translators' email addresses with asterisks during the webinar. So, if\\xa0I want to know who the webinar translator is, I need to go into settings and look for\\xa0the email address associated with translation.

Zoom allows for you to chat with your friends, meet with companies and go to classes but lacks the security options that should be standard in this technical day and age. All in all, if you're looking for a 30 min session thats free... pick up zoom, otherwise I would honestly recommend discord for lenghty chats. \", \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom does exactly what its meant to do. There's video chatting, screen share, classroom breakouts for teachers or groups within groups etc. It can be used for many reasons and definitely trumps skype etc. \\nThe ui is reasonable but not the best to use but the learning curve is not steep at all. The call quality is usually solid as well. It's also really cool that it features a background option that does not require green screen to work effectively. Its the most attractive feature in my opinion.  \", \"Cons:\\xa0Okay, so firstly I would likely choose discord over zoom. Don't get me wrong, zoom is not bad for what it is. In fact, it's great. But... it lacks in certain areas. For instance, security. A class can be hijacked by anyone with the password and code, which did happen to our class once or twice... whereas in discord there is the option to share a specific amount of entries. Another issue with zoom is the ui, specifically during screen sharing. It can be irritating to constantly have to move the box or panels that show up from zoom. It'd probably be better to minimize them totally if possible.  This one isn't a functional issue but more of a flavor issue. There is no dark mode yet.

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0With Zoom I'm saving time driving to meetings that I can have online, and I'm making phone conversations more personal by having them face-to-face. It's miles better than something like Skype or Google Hangouts because the people you're meeting don't need to have an account, they just hit the link and enter their display name. I've found call quality to be higher than most VOIP services I've tried - and it's carrying video too, so that must be some kind of magic they've invented. My calls/meetings never seem to break up or glitch. All in all, this is one of a handful of products I would struggle to go without.\", \"Pros:\\xa0My clients think I'm seriously professional when they get a link to a Zoom meeting instead of a phone number or a Skype username. What they don't realise is that Zoom is way easier for me than either of those methods. I can host any number of people in a meeting, I can record it on the cloud and locally, I can share my screen, mute people, or just chat face-to-face, all without any technical setup. My favourite feature is the recording, because it saves me having to take many notes. But private chat is another really helpful one when you're in a big call and just want to pick up on a point with one person.\", \"Cons:\\xa0I guess we were all rattled by the security problems Zoom had recently. I'm not aware of my webcam light ever coming on so I don't think I was affected. I don't want to have to stop using Zoom because it's a key part of my sales and project management process.

They make meeting invitations easy to copy to send to other attendees and the quality of the calls is always good.  There have been no problems I can think of during my use since the pandemic started last March.  I really appreciate Zoom offering free meetings (time limited) but do have an account in order to have longer meetings when necessary.  I use Zoom socially rather than for business as I require a HIPAA compliant platform for work but Zoom is really great for connecting socially. \", \"Cons:\\xa0I have no real complaints about Zoom.  I appreciate that they added a security upgrade in terms of asking for a password but I choose to not use that option since my calls are strictly social. I do have to carefully check or uncheck boxes use of a password, who gets audio/video, etc. when setting up a meeting but once you know what to look for, this is not a big deal.   It's also really easy, if you have a larger group, for people to talk over one another and this may take some kind of moderating by the host but again, not an insurmountable problem.  \"]\n",

For example, if you look at Google, the implemented it in their Gmail app. Now there's an area, front and center, dedicated to chatting with other people. So it looks like other companies are scrambling to jump on board this new trend of virtual communications. But since zoom was one of the first to market, and one that many people who are already familiar with, I will continue using it. Also, I don't really have any other reasons to switch since I've already been using it, but also because everyone else is comfortable using zoom. So that's kind of how the network effects happen, with first to market products. Things that rely on a network of people using, it becomes like a snowball. It happened to venmo, it happened to zoom. Other companies try to come in and take market share, realize they weren't the fortunate ones to get in early and gain that network effect early on.\\n\", 'Pros:\\xa0The thing I like most about zoom is how easy it was to set up a conference meeting between multiple people.

It's like a reliable hammer - good for most things, but not good for many specific things. So if you need something more specific for your use-case, then there are other things out there that might be better suited for you.\\nOf course, if you just need something to throw a presentation every few months, or every now and then, then it's pretty good for that. Although the price then doesn't justify the low use case for the presentation side. And if you're just in it for the one-on-one side, then you have better options if you're willing to invest and if the cost is justified for you. But at the same time, if you only need it a few times a year, then Zoom or Skype can get the job done in a reliable way.\\nSo I would say, don't dismiss Zoom, but don't fall in love with it either, if you're doing frequent presentations. \", \"Pros:\\xa0The free plan is pretty generous with up to 100 participants for 40 minutes.

It integrates great with WordPress through many plugins, or Book Like a Boss, CalendarHero and some other scheduling tools.\\nThe quality of audio is good most of the time.

If you have a co-host who isn\\'t familiar, it becomes an embarrassing trip to start teaching them in the middle of the presentation.\\nMany times, when I was a participant, not a host, I could see the hosts struggling with settings and getting things to work. Some hosts don\\'t even know how to mute participants so it gets very distracting.\\nIt often glitches due to either the internet connection or some other reason, but I have a very fast internet speed that doesn\\'t present me any problems in other tools.\\nSome things about the tool aren\\'t intuitive, and they haven\\'t fixed them or changed them at all, in all this time, and I\\'d imagine, a huge amount of feedback. \\nSince it\\'s mainly software-based, people with Windows 10 S will not be able to use it, and you\\'d have to instruct participants how to \"Join from browser\".

This allows for an easy email invite (or text) and participants can just click the link to join the meeting--very simple. \\nIt is also convenient that Zoom has created an app that one can use on the iPhone, which allows flexibility on when and where you use Zoom. ', 'Cons:\\xa0The thing I liked the least about this software is that in order to have meetings without a time limit, you must subscribe to the service and pay a fee. The reason I do not like this is because I do not feel that the features of Zoom are worth the subscription fee. Google Meet is entirely free and you can have meetings without a time limit there and there is honestly nothing that Zoom has that Google Meet does not. ']\n",

I like the chat option alot and that so many people can join the meeting. The recording feature is great to, especially for interviews where you can set it up so that you can record on two tracks.  Overall I think this is a great software.', \"Cons:\\xa0I have two main complaints:\\n1. Setting up advanced meetings has no option on the main page and it can take a while to navigate to that options.  In the tab to set up meetings on the main page there should be an additional option to schedule a meeting in the future. \\n\\n2.  I think that zoom is worth paying for, but there is no lower level usage plan.  I really only do large meetings infrequently, I would love a credit system for when I need this so I don't have to pay for a whole month and worry about monthly billing and overage.

Although they were initially skeptical, almost all members are satisfied with the experience, and it doesn't seem to have hurt public participation at all. \", \"Pros:\\xa0The Zoom platform is pretty stable, and I really like that citizens do not have to sign up for Zoom to participate.  It's very easy to attend a meeting, and only slightly more difficult to schedule or start one.  For power users, there are a lot of configurable options available by logging into the Zoom website.  I also appreciate that live streaming of meetings is built-in, so our citizens are still able to view them on our website.  \", 'Cons:\\xa0I do wish there were more granular controls to distinguish between different types of attendees.  In Meetings, one is either a host/co-host, or a participant.  Webinars offer one more level -- a panelist, but it would be nice to have more configuration of roles and privileges.  Email from zoom with registration and invitation information is a little flaky.  Some are delayed, and some never seem to arrive at all.']\n",

I have no doubt in my mind that it is the best platform to interact via video call.', 'Pros:\\xa0I think what I like the most about Zoom is that whenever you have the opportunity to be the host of a meeting, the application or service gives you a type of passcode and link in order for the other participants to enter. This is really important, because it ensures that only the people you want, will be at the meeting. Another aspect I adore about Zoom, is that you as the host, can decide whether you are the only one talking in a certain moment, or if the participants can as well.', \"Cons:\\xa0There is nothing I would say that is negative about Zoom. The platform is quite easy to use and I think that everyone is able to handle it at first glance. Perhaps one feature that could be very useful is to save the chat. Sometimes people prefer chatting rather than speaking through the Zoom call, and having this feature of saving important details of the chat could be very beneficial. Maybe in some way saving it to the computer's desktop.\"]\n",

It is probably something to keep in mind with all of the video conferencing type software, but it certainly seems like Zoom has not handled information security properly in the past, so this is something that I try to be aware of.\"]\n",
