      "[\"Overall:\\xa0Dropbox Business has, for the most part, been our media company's go-to file storage and sharing application since we began primarily working from home a little over a year ago. But after 5+ years of consistent use, I can't say I've noticed a significant improvement in the software's usability. We still seem to experience the same issues we did when we first began using the software. We've been on the lookout for a software to switch to for some time, and may just officially make the move to Frame.io some time in the near future.\", \"Pros:\\xa0In terms of basic file sharing (documents, videos, or audio files), Dropbox Business gets the job done. There are some basic features available which allow you to customize the files you've shared (you can set files to be non-downloadable, password protect them, or even set the shared link to expire after a certain date).\\n\\nOne of the features we've found the most useful as a media company is the ability to send out a File Request. This is a feature that allows you to create an upload link that can be shared out to as many people as you need. Once members of that group have uploaded files to your Dropbox using the link, the files will appear on your Dropbox, in a folder that you've preconfigured to be associated with that file request. Users cannot see what exists on your Dropbox on their side, but you're able to secure the files you need.\\n\\nWhile there are some helpful, advanced features, all in all I would say Dropbox Business will probably work just fine for your purposes if you aren't too concerned about having a bunch of fancy features.\", 'Cons:\\xa0I seem to constantly run into strange issues when using Dropbox.\\n\\nFor example, although you are able to see all of the files that you\\'ve recently deleted in the Trash, you are not able to search the Trash. You can only perform a search for files that are still technically \"live\" on your Dropbox account. So if you need a file you think you\\'ve deleted, you have to scroll through the Trash and search for it yourself. I would think that regardless of what exactly you or your company is using Dropbox for, a search bar feature for the Trash would be useful, and would save you a ton of time.\\n\\nAdditionally, more often than not, the progress bar on the bottom of the browser might say a file has completed uploading, but the file won\\'t display on the screen. A refresh seems to do the trick, but this is a longstanding issue we\\'ve run into, and contributes to my overall perception of Dropbox as a \"clunky,\" outdated software.']\n",

I conducted some research on storage capacity, cost, and security, among other things... Right away, Dropbox was my first option. I knew I had to make little to no changes to their daily routine in order to sell this migration opportunity to the rest of the company, but I also had to prove it was worth the investment. I joined up the office for a free trial, and the crew was immediately impressed with how simple the program is to use. Most participants were familiar with traditional desktop file folders, and thanks to Dropbox's features, I was able to install the program directly on their devices.\", \"Pros:\\xa0Dropbox's user interface is basic and intuitive. In addition, the pricing is acceptable from a business viewpoint. I also like Dropbox's added security by functioning as a digital backup in case something goes wrong. I appreciate that Dropbox can be accessed from a variety of platforms and devices, including a website, a computer application, a mobile phone, or a tablet, which is convenient while working from home, from different places, or when on the road. Furthermore, transferring documents using Dropbox saves time and money since it is faster, more secure, and avoids paper waste.\", 'Cons:\\xa0As with every cloud service, there is a cost component that must be carefully addressed before deciding to proceed with the solution in question. Dropbox for Business is likely to be too costly for small and medium-sized enterprises. There is a 30-day free trial period for restricted users, and if you want to go with the premium option, you will be charged $750 per year for just 5 user licenses. The expense of adding new users continues to rise.

Dropbox has saved me from losing hours of work by safely storing my songs and music ideas.', 'Pros:\\xa0Dropbox is a web based service that gives you a free space with an option of additional storage for a reasonable monthly fee. As a musician, it is essential to protect and share your music. I am able to upload files onto my Dropbox storage and send direct access to anyone I choose from all over the globe.

Given that several of our employees were already familiar with Dropbox for their personal needs, the transition to the \"cloud\" was quite easy.  Just upload your existing files into organized folders, and you\\'re done.  At first, it took awhile to upload everything to the cloud due to the sheer volume of files being uploaded.  But after the initial document \"dump\", adding new documents/files has been a breeze.  ', \"Pros:\\xa0I like Dropbox's simple and easy-to-use interface.  And from a business standpoint, the price is fairly reasonable.  I also love the security that Dropbox provides by acting as a digital backup just in case anything happens.\\n\\nI like that you can access Dropbox through multiple platforms and devices--you can access it through a website, a computer application, your cell phone or your tablet--which is helpful when you're working from home, from different locations, or while you're on the road.

      "['Overall:\\xa0Dropbox has provided the opportunity for employees in the organization to manage and share files locally and remotely without the need for carrying thumb drives from workstation to workstation. Not only has this feature enabled flexibility and efficiency in the work space but also improving the standard of work, saving time and energy as compared to other file management solution. While the sharing of information is critical Dropbox for Business allows the administrators to issue special permissions for users to access links and files. Administrators can further perform other security tasks such as the setting of expiration dates for every information that has been shared to the Cloud. This type of security measures are available to avoid breach of information on Dropbox for Business. Overall I would recommend this solution to any business that have the ability to implement the system. ', \"Pros:\\xa0The first time I heard about Dropbox for Business I didn't have the slightest clue what this system could do, let alone the benefits and impact it could have on an organization. What I like most about the software is the user friendly interface and how easy it is to setup an account compared to other systems out there. Once the account has been setup, you can give employees access immediately, so they can start syncing files, uploading files and creating folders between other computers from any location. As an administrator Dropbox for business made my life easier when managing multiple accounts. It gives you the flexibility to track existing files, lost files and other issues that come up from time to time. And if you already have Dropbox installed, you can upgrade to the business option from a free or Pro option, therefore incorporating existing user accounts into a business account without any additional work. \", \"Cons:\\xa0As it is common for any cloud solution, there is a price factor that needs to be considered carefully before a decision is made to go with the solution at hand. Dropbox for Business maybe a bit too expensive for small to medium size businesses. There is a 30-day free trial use for limited users only and if you do choose to go with the paid option, you will be looking at paying a price of $750 per year for just 5 user licenses. If you want to add more users the cost keeps increasing. Having Dropbox running within your organization can also impact the performance of your network bandwidth, that's if your users are uploading large files during peak production hours. You may have to do some tweaking and configuration from a network perspective to accommodate this new solution.  \"]\n",
