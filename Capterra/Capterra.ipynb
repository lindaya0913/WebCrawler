The controls well designed and implemented to offer the easiest way possible for users to use them. The meeting experience it offer in spite of slow internet speeds. The wonderful features that like chats, polls, break out rooms, third party integrations had given me the best way to have meetings. Zoom is the best software option for online meetings and is still the best option to use than in person meetings.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Background noise management is not yet so good though I assume that this is technically possible to achieve.

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0It gets the job done, it has many features, and has a generous Free plan for one-on-one meetings.\\nIt has a general use type of service. It's like a reliable hammer - good for most things, but not good for many specific things. So if you need something more specific for your use-case, then there are other things out there that might be better suited for you.\\nOf course, if you just need something to throw a presentation every few months, or every now and then, then it's pretty good for that. Although the price then doesn't justify the low use case for the presentation side. And if you're just in it for the one-on-one side, then you have better options if you're willing to invest and if the cost is justified for you. But at the same time, if you only need it a few times a year, then Zoom or Skype can get the job done in a reliable way.\\nSo I would say, don't dismiss Zoom, but don't fall in love with it either, if you're doing frequent presentations. \", \"Pros:\\xa0The free plan is pretty generous with up to 100 participants for 40 minutes. It's great for many small-purpose presentations, but don't get extended with Q&A.\\nMostly the free plan is great for one-on-one since it's not time-limited. It integrates great with WordPress through many plugins, or Book Like a Boss, CalendarHero and some other scheduling tools.\\nThe quality of audio is good most of the time. Same as for the video, good most of the time.\\nThe added advantage is that now, with the pandemic, it got more press and more people learned how to use it as well.\\n\", 'Cons:\\xa0I don\\'t like the fact that software needs to be installed. It does have a web version, but even then it\\'s less reliable.\\nIt requires a learning period to get on how to use it. If you have a co-host who isn\\'t familiar, it becomes an embarrassing trip to start teaching them in the middle of the presentation.\\nMany times, when I was a participant, not a host, I could see the hosts struggling with settings and getting things to work. Some hosts don\\'t even know how to mute participants so it gets very distracting.\\nIt often glitches due to either the internet connection or some other reason, but I have a very fast internet speed that doesn\\'t present me any problems in other tools.\\nSome things about the tool aren\\'t intuitive, and they haven\\'t fixed them or changed them at all, in all this time, and I\\'d imagine, a huge amount of feedback. \\nSince it\\'s mainly software-based, people with Windows 10 S will not be able to use it, and you\\'d have to instruct participants how to \"Join from browser\".

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0In Zoom, it is easy to work with clients or customers and multiple individuals at different times or locations to collaborate and complete tasks.  Zoom Meetings are stable and easy to use; it is very convenient to schedule meetings and invite participants. \\n\\nIf you are using your smartphone to participate in a meeting while driving with a hands-free kit, it is easy to use if you have a desktop or computer present, the connection seems more stable than other platforms for video conferencing currently available. What makes zoom so great is how portable it is. This application is lightweight and can be used on any device and browser. \\n\\nZoom stands out from the rest of the typical video conferencing industry thanks to Zoom's ability to record sessions and control the screen during video calls. I use it both with a desktop computer and with a mobile phone, I definitely recommend Zoom Meetings as a must-have business tool.\", \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom has been my favorite video conferencing software for more than 2 years now and I can personally attest that it is one of the best software currently available. Integrated video meeting, voice, webinar, chat, and video conferencing services are easy, reliable, and innovative. It aligns easily with your existing workflows and makes scheduling meetings a breeze because of its integration with Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar.\\n\\nThe software is constantly updated so you can work remotely even easier with versatile new features every day. By using it, you can perform the same tasks in a more convenient manner than you would have been able to do in person. It makes collaborating easier with colleagues or clients with features like a share-screen and remote access. \\n\\nWe would face many problems without Zoom in today's COVID- 19 environment unless we were able to provide clients and colleagues with simple ways to communicate. Having the ability to send a link and jump into a quick call is very convenient and useful. Additionally, it seems to have a greater rate of engagement with our clients who are reluctant to give out their phone numbers but want to speak with us. It appears that many people already use Zoom as their platform of choice for calling or chatting even when we have other options available on the market.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Depending on the organization where your account exists, your zoom account may have many restrictions that the management puts in place and this can be frustrating at times. Some precautions seem overly cautious to me, but I can't complain going forward if it's not my job to protect sensitive internal information or communications. \\n\\nI used to experience some unresponsiveness sometimes when I worked with multiple screens, but this was rare. The problem was fixed in the future updates of the software, and I am not experiencing this issue anymore.\", 'Switched From:\\xa0Microsoft Teams', 'Reasons for Switching to Zoom Meetings:\\xa0Microsoft Teams was bulky and consumed too much memory, while Zoom is much lighter and uses much less computing resources.']\n",

It has changed the way I deal with people. It has added an ease to the meeting process and has enhanced the relationships that I have with people who know longer live nearby.

      "['Overall:\\xa0Zoom is to communication what Google is to search engines. I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard of it. You\\'ve probably used it. Unless your business involves wrenches or blowtorches, odds are high you\\'ve even used it in the last year. If you haven\\'t formed an opinion by now, then maybe Zoom isn\\'t for you. But even if you have no need for it in your work life, there\\'s no reason not to implement it into your personal life. What better way to catch up with your Facebook friends than on Zoom? Signed up for a dating service? Use Zoom. Need to discuss a legal matter as an animated cat? Zoom! With Zoom, there\\'s no reason to remain out of touch, as long as you don\\'t have to touch anything. I mean, it\\'s still limited to screens and digital representations. Not the best way to give someone a hug. But after a year of social distancing, are hugs even still allowed? Might have to ask that animated cat for advice on that matter. But hugs aside, Zoom is the perfect way to talk to someone when you can\\'t be there in person. And if you don\\'t want to talk? There\\'s a convenient button that turns off your camera and microphone. \"Technical difficulties! I can\\'t hear-\"And he\\'s gone. Zoom!', \"Pros:\\xa0Everyone uses it, so if you're having trouble getting started, it takes no effort to troubleshoot it. It's also perfect for free communication, as long as you're not hosting a group chat (more than two participants). If you're the host of a group chat, you'll need to either watch the clock or your wallet, but even then it's affordable, especially if you're using it for business. It might be less profitable to pay for a service to host a chat where no one is earning for the team, but Zoom still lets you have that group meeting (sometimes for free if you keep the session short enough), and if you happen to be conducting the kind of business that leads to profits, then the cost of that meeting shouldn't matter. Finally, it's really easy to connect to a meeting, and almost as easy to host one. Most of the time, it's just a matter of copy and pasting a link and clicking on it. But even if you have to sign as yourself or the member of an organization, it doesn't take much effort to get going. Just make sure your camera and microphone work. It's only as good as the equipment you use.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Other than the background effects being average at best, I don't have much criticisms against Zoom. It can sometimes be difficult to customize your view port, and scanning participants for the active speaker can be a challenge if your setup is confused. And screen sharing can get awkward when you have too many windows to choose from, or if your share space is too nested within a framework of open windows. But most of these issues are easy to overcome once you get familiar with the system. Like Google's technology suite, it's only as overwhelming as the first time you use it. Once you've explored what it has to offer, you'll find it's pretty easy to use.\"]\n",

It integrates into Slack and Outlook, it\\'s easy to use even for those less tech-savvy, the desktop app is wonderful for reminding you of upcoming meetings and makes it easy to schedule through Outlook, Gmail, or another calendar, and the Zoom settings when in a meeting are easy to use as well. The background options are both very helpful and fun, including the \"blur\" feature which I love. There\\'s even an option to \"touch up your appearance\" which is wonderful when sitting in front of a camera all day. Additionally, recording is very easy to set up, even when I\\'m not on the call, and I love the feature of Zoom transcribing recordings when saved to the cloud.

This is just based on my personal preferences, because the functionality itself is great; however, I like the body of invites set up a particular way and do not like how, when using the plug-in, Zoom auto-populates its own invite into the body. This just means that I have to create an invite, schedule through Zoom, and then erase the auto-populated body. I've actually disabled this plug-in due to it auto-populating each time I edit an invite and then will auto-send the invite, which results in me having to go back to fix it, and resend again. Now, I schedule directly through the Zoom desktop app and auto-populate that way so if I need to edit the invite, it does not auto-populate in the body of the invite.

The ability to communicate with just one student or one group of students if I am in a different breakout room is nonexistent which can be very difficult when trying to supervise or communicate a message. The lack of ability to just mute one student from using the chat can be challenging as sometimes just one student needs this ability removed yet it is an all or nothing for the class. I also don't like how I can't adjust the timer on breakout rooms, change names of breakout rooms, or add a room once they are open. This eats up precious time throughout the day closing/opening etc. There is also no ability to close just one room. I also can't save room titles from day to day which again eats up time when I am making the same four rooms for Reader's Workshop and Math Workshop every day.

      "['Overall:\\xa0Overall, I am a fan of the product (even if I am extremely tired of teaching through this medium-I know its temporary).  I have used Google Meet (incredibly glitchy and very limited), WEBEX, though admittedly my familiarity is limited here.  Zoom tops them all in my book.  The embedded tools and ease of use with calendar invited and integration into my Google Suite makes it even easier to use.  ', 'Pros:\\xa0Zoom is an easy application to use and navigate.  It allows a host of actions and provides a myraid of controls for the user/account holder.  As a teacher, it allows lots of controls for classroom purposes such as control of the chat function, and control of almost all user functions after meeting has started.  Of course, within the preferences, you can control much more of the meeting and its users prior to the meeting/session  starting.  It has become a welcome addtion for distance learning.  ', 'Cons:\\xa0The two primary complaints have to do with the toolbar to do things like annotating a screen/document when sharing a screen or using the whiteboard function.  One part of that function makes some sense given what technical aspects.  You are basically layering something on top of a document, so if you move the document around on the screen the annotations DO NOT move with the document.  This is frustrating but understandable. Also, you have to close out the annotating toolbar to do other things instead of just being able to click on a different part of the Zoom session screen to perform that function.  By that I mean, WHen the annotate toolbar is open you cannot perform any other functions in Zoom until you close the toolbar function.  That is the frustrating part for this user.  My last complaint is more of a minor one at the account management level.  When adding alternative hosts as we often do for our district for substitute teachers, administrators, etc, you can just add to an ever-growing list.  You have to completely re-enter the ENTIRE list.  Our District IT team has repeatedly told us this is a Zoom issue, not anything they can control/improve on the District management end.  This is ridiculously time-consuming and needs to be updated.  I should be able to add a new alternative host simply by adding a comma and putting in the new hostname.  ']\n",

It has a variety of features and integrations packed in - surveys, webinars, chat, private chat, connecting to the conference using the phone number (something a lot of competitors don't offer but is handy sometimes). Because of its friendliness to the average user and overall quality of video and sound, Zoom is the only choice that has all of the features that we are looking for.\", 'Pros:\\xa0As said in the title, Zoom is a must-have if you work from home in a team. In the time of epidemics, the noun Zoom has become as popular as the noun Google is nowadays - everyone is using it one way or another. And Zoom deserved this right way. With Zoom everything is simple and easy to use with a nice and simple user interface. Zoom allows you to communicate with your team like a champ. You can create breakout rooms where you split teams to do the job in pairs for example or you can even organize a public webinar that can attend multiple thousand people with no problem or lag.\\nI remember times when we tried another video conferencing tool and it was an awful experience a few years ago. Everybody could hear echo and the quality was not so great. With Zoom and smart algorithms, we never experienced that and the only person speaking can be heard every time even if not all participants are using dedicated headphones.\\nOne feature I especially like is virtual backgrounds. My room is a real mess when we work from home and I am frightened that if my coworkers see what it looks like that I might have some problems. With Zoom I just click one button and immediately I can be on a beach or even in space. It works well most of the time.', 'Cons:\\xa0Pricing is somewhat in my opinion overrated if you are planning to use Zoom professionally. It features a free plan but you can have conferences of only 40 mins and with a limited number of participants. Also, sometimes recorded sessions take a long to encode on a local computer but maybe is that because of a little older hardware in my current PC I use Zoom with. I miss the feature to trim cloud recording. Sometimes I or my colleagues start recording a little too early and if they chose cloud recording there is no cloud trim function and then we have to download the replay and trim it manually and then upload it to some other service. Not a big deal but it would be a lot easier with few clicks.']\n",

Reactions, virtual backgrounds, chats, recording co-hosting, breakout rooms. Whats even better, is the administrator of the calls has a lot of freedom for how to set up calls. You can have participants hidden to one another (like a webinar), you can have the chat disabled between participants or entirely. Even their post call features are useful. You can see who attended, you can password protect the recording, and you can have a transcription of the recording. I especially like that participants can call in with a phone, laptop, tablet, or any device.', 'Cons:\\xa0While the features are all great, there are a few missing that would really make it the top conferencing option. One would be built-in meeting notes (like mircosoft teams). Another would be live captions for audio-impaired participants. And finally, I wish there was an option to reduce the quality of your video, because with higher HD devices, Zoom sucks all the bandwith of internet and makes it impossible for other devices to browse or stream.

Zoom's a strong option for anyone needing to teach a class through the internet or host online meetings with international people and I believe it will become a better feature as time moves on.\", \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom has been a great software for online meetings since 2013. Although only a couple of people had used Zoom pre-2020, it started to emerge during the time Covid-19 started affecting schools. Due to people having social distance, having school in-person was essentially impossible without getting sick. Zoom was a strong solution to this problem and is still being used more than ever today. Like most students, I have been only using Zoom as a way to attend school during this pandemic but I do not mind having online school especially since I know doing it may save my peers from contracting the virus. Zoom has provided a way for us students to attend school without having the risk of exposing or being exposed to Covid-19. Zoom's software is easily manageable as most people in my family could use it without issue. It's video chat software allows for the option to quickly turn on or off both your mic and camera in an instant. You can also message people through a chat during a meeting so there's no need to turn on your mic to ask a question. The quick command menu allows you to ask your teacher multiple things without having to get their attention while they're teaching. Accessing a Zoom meeting is also very simple as you can send or receive a link that will instantly put you into the meeting or enter the room code. Zoom has a feature where the host can send you into separate groups privately which is very effective when doing group projects.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Zoom has some flaws that other softwares already have integrated into their system. One example is Discord which allows the user to turn up the mic volume of anyone in a meeting while allowing you to simultaneously turn down the mic of someone else. Zoom does have to ability to allow you to add contacts but personally I don't use this feature because there's not a quicker way to do other than adding their email address. I think this takes too long and so, therefore, don't use this feature as much. Zoom seems to be strictly a video, call, and message application when many of its users are students and teachers. Integrating a feature that allows teachers to hand out assignments in an organized way would seem more beneficial. Also, it does seem like Zoom could add more features to make it seems like an software that's used more for than just school and work. It could add a social media feature, although this is a hypothetical situation, similar to Snapchat's ability to send pictures to anyone in an instant. Or add a stories feature where teachers can remind students that an assignment may be due while making it look more interesting than just an email notification on your phone.\", 'Switched From:\\xa0Google Meet', \"Reasons for Switching to Zoom Meetings:\\xa0Well I personallly didn't make the switch but my teachers did.

Our dealings with Zoom customer support is minimal but for the most part, they're okay, not great. As we work as AV specialists, and we inform Zoom CS that we do, they still often do not refer us to their back-end engineers when we have more advanced issues, rather they direct us to their online resource library, which we are already aware of and consult first when we have issues.

This leaves you with the only option of purchasing the pro version which can cost you either $15 per month or an annual fee of $150.

Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.\\n\\nI have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too. \\n\\nI will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while.\", \"Pros:\\xa0This is a great time to use modern software like Zoom Meetings & Chat for video conference and meetings. I will try to go over all the features which I believe makes this software customizable. \\n\\nYou can use it either through a desktop, ipad or tablet, as well as your cell phone. The cellphone or other tablets may have limited features though. The thing I like the most about Zoom is being able to schedule several meeting, invite individual members to the meeting,  either through a meeting ID number and password (optional) or a specific URL as an easy access link. I believe all invited need to have the software downloaded AND create a login.   For training purposes, you can easily show your screen to your meeting members, so if they have a hard time accessing or understanding the information given to them, you can show them step by step. The host can also screen record the meeting to share with someone that wasn't available to attend the meeting. The host is the only one who can all members at once and individually mute/unmute. Everyone has the option of seeing a gallery of members on one screen or one person at a time (generally whoever is speaking). Lastly, there is a chat option included, but if you're on a tablet or phone you can't access the chat and see members at the same time. The chat is good to share links or information shared that you want members to access.  Sorry about the list but they really have SO MANY OPTIONS.\", \"Cons:\\xa0The host MUST have a strong internet capability otherwise there may be some lagging so keep that in mind. Also, members that are accessing the meeting over a phone or tablet may have a limited amount of features, so I highly recommend a desktop (with camera) and hard internet wired for a more professional approach. I do believe they have currently waived the 40 minute max for meetings, but generally, I think  you have to pay extra to have meetings longer than 40 minutes. This is not usually a problem, unless you have a very long meeting.\\n\\nMeeting Security/Safety is another issue. I would HIGHLY suggest not sharing URL links online. ONLY SHARE URLS OR MEETING IDS DIRECTLY WITH WHO YOU WANT TO ATTEND, AND HAVE IT PASSWORD PROTECTED. If your meeting isn't password protected, it may be likely that anyone could access your meeting. The last thing you want is a stranger jumping into your meeting and roaming free on what they say or show. There are people like that out there, so save yourself the trouble. \"]\n",

Besides the expected (and helpful) virtual whiteboard and screen sharing available to both me as the teacher and other users as students, there are also Breakout Rooms. This is essential for learning any foreign language; the Breakout Rooms simulate partnered or smaller group activities that are necessary for practicing the target language in context with another learner. These allow students to speak one-on-one (or in small groups) with each other for a brief exercise before returning to the Main Room of the video chat. The teacher can also check in on each of the private Breakout Rooms to make sure everything is running smoothly, and if a student requires immediate help, there is another button within a Breakout Room to let the teacher know. Lastly, one feature that I have not found in other video chat software such as Skype or Google Hangouts is the virtual hand-raising button. This prevents users from speaking over each other, and the host/teacher can immediately tell which student would like to ask a question.

It is always harder to conduct a meeting virtually than in real life, especially when that meeting is a *language lesson.* It is the first stages, however, so I and my students will have to adapt over the next few weeks.

This forces students to share their own screens with each other, and/or have other apps open at the same time.

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing.\", \"Pros:\\xa0It's honestly very easy to use. Even our clients who don't necessarily have Zoom downloaded prior to a Zoom Meeting find it easy to get up and running which really takes the burden off of us and relieves any back and forth having to explain how to work the program during time that should be spent already on a call. The functionality of the software does not change very much between the free version and the more premium versions which I appreciated; the paid version really only seems to remove the restrictions of the free version so it didn't feel like having to learn a brand new program once we made the switch. Everything is labeled fairly clearly, and I didn't have to research the software extensively to find out how to work each function because of how user-friendly it is. The options to use your computer audio or call in by phone really makes it shine I think though, as most video conferencing software does not provide the either/or option, which I think anyone who has been in a video conference will know only leads to lackluster audio quality. \", 'Cons:\\xa0I think if Zoom created a handbook or user guide that they sent to each person or business who purchases their software, it would really put them above the rest. The software is user-friendly, but I did have to google a few things to figure out how to work certain elements of the software. I understand the reasoning behind defaulting every call to password protected, but I think it should be optional, as there are already a lot of numbers involved in accessing a call and throwing in a password has confused more than one of my meeting participants. The invitation to each zoom meeting I think is also a little unclear, when you first start using the program it is an overwhelming amount of information to have put in front of you and with the addition of multiple phone numbers by time zone and two different links it can be difficult to puzzle out. If it was a little more clearly defined I think it would be perfect, I know I had to trial and error myself before figuring out how to do it right every time.

No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings.

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0My experience with this software has been reliable when excluding certain behaviors, such as moving Zoom windows around when recording or using the annotation tool. I haven't got the chance to use frequently this software on other devices, but I have mixed feelings when using it on a Linux system because of the aforementioned issues. I find Zoom is a solid option for one-on-one meetings, particularly considering everything needed works perfectly on a free plan. For bigger meetings, a Premium plan is a must and one can still benefit a lot from this software. It has enabled me to do screen sharing very easily without having to know anything about video recording or editing. Even on low-end PCs, I feel that Zoom is quite capable of rendering a good enough video for formal meetings that need to be shared later by other means. The encoding used for exported videos is a great compromise between size and quality, making it a viable option when it comes to sharing a meeting online. I wouldn't recommend Zoom for producing high-quality videos intended for commercial use or for presentations with a large audience (above 100 participants), but it works perfectly fine for personal projects and for most business meetings. I find I could benefit more if I were able to use all the available features as one often needs to rely on workarounds such as using an image editing tool to make drawings from screenshots instead of being able to directly work on the screen as intended by the software.\", \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom brings to the table premium features for free. One-on-one meetings are not time-limited or missing any essential option. It is possible to set up recurring meetings by generating a permanent Zoom link, which is very useful to have custom links for many different contacts. Zoom makes it possible to share the screen with others: either to record a solo session; screen share with others in a meeting while having the ability to record audio and video; share only a specific window or the entire desktop and there's also a quick way to switch between different screens from participants, all of it being configurable in the application. Scheduling a new meeting is straightforward and numerous options are presented to make it easy to obtain the desired behavior by default when launching a meeting. Meetings can also be integrated with external calendars and provide more advanced options to facilitate interactions when the meeting starts, such as automatically recording on the local computer and asking for a password to prevent unauthorized access. Being able to chat with attendees and store all relevant information about them in an address book inside Zoom are other features that make interactions with frequent users a breeze. There are plenty of settings available from the main window to adjust audio, video and recording details and even integration with dual monitors.\", \"Cons:\\xa0Technical issues are present with the Linux desktop application in certain hardware conditions, especially with the annotation tool, rendering it totally useless. While using that tool, the screen isn't updated in real-time and won't allow displaying drawings with a transparent background to make it possible to annotate on the screen while keeping the desktop visible in the background. There are also various notable glitches when moving Zoom windows around, such as the video window being duplicated when recording and staying on the screen for extended periods of time, ruining the quality of any recording being made. Because of those shortcomings, it is impractical to try and move the windows when recording and some features simply need to be forgotten at those times. It is also inconvenient that the toolbar won't display properly when set at the bottom of the screen, as it only opens from top to bottom, making the list of tools go outside the bottom part of the screen and effectively unreachable. There is no way to resize the toolbar which occupies too much space on tiny monitors (screen size of 13 inches and below). In a similar fashion, the main window when a meeting is happening can't easily be resized as some buttons will disappear and become unusable, making it harder to record the session or end the meeting.\"]\n",

We decided to make the switch from GoToMeeting (a great alternative to Zoom) because it fit our needs more accurately. Zooms customer support is remarkably responsive and very quick to solve any issues encountered.\\n\\nPros\\nZoom video conference calling and webinar is fitting for any sized company or organization. Meetings can be scheduled within seconds and added directly from Zoom's platform to Google Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, or Outlook Calendar; which allows you to set up invites and add additional attendees.\\n\\nZoom provides the option to either enroll in a monthly or an annual plan, in which you can choose to deactivate and/or reactivate at any time (beneficial for saving extra bucks if you do not run regular monthly webinars).

Zoom includes various features, i.e. live screen-sharing, whiteboard, etc., which helps relieve the difficulties of working remotely.  \\n\\nIf you are holding an international meeting, I.e. training, trainees can join by laptop and listen over laptop speakers (they would have to use laptop and not call in directly via phone to avoid having to pay for extra international call credits - which costs an additional /month). \\nZoom comes in handy when working with distributed teams; Zoom's conference calling features are great for doing demos, exercises, sprint planning, etc.\", \"Cons:\\xa0When joining a webinar or a call via mobile device, it's unclear how to join audio (I thought there was something wrong with my phone because it was telling me my audio was on but I could not hear anything during the webinar - turns out I couldn't see the audio number which was hidden behind the webinar).

The software's improved security feature for license accounts ensures that only authorized users have access to a specific meeting ID, which prevents unauthorized users or intruders. In addition, the software's recording feature also makes it easy for the students to review what had been discussed during the classes he/she attended as the professors can record the class sessions and upload it in the class folder for easy access to the students.

That being said, Zoom does a great job of being good at the ones that really matter to me. With zoom, I do not travel as much because a face to face conference seems to suffice most situations and the meetings can be flexible to work with different time zones. Having a link to my meetings directly in the calendar invite has been a huge benefit for me as clients know exactly where to go to access the conference. This has been a good tool and I would recommend it to my peers. ', \"Pros:\\xa0I think we can all agree that one of the worst things about conferencing with a new client or employee is walking them through the setup and install if the tool. Then going through and making sure their microphone is connected and so forth. This is what makes Zoom so great. The one click install to start using the tool really makes things simple, streamlined, and best of all, it makes you look like an expert because it is set up in seconds.   Being able to see everyone's face in the meeting is a game changer as well because your meetings are more personable and you can really gauge people's responses to items as you bring them up. They take the ease of use even further by being able to chat, mute and raise your hand, this is especially true if there are multiple people on a call. It is simply a great tool. \", 'Cons:\\xa0Some of the biggest cons I see are:\\n\\nNot being able to configure backgrounds. Not doing can add distractions\\n\\nOccasionally, there are times where one of my attendees or I will join the call only to be the lone person in the conference.  Then we have to leave and rejoin to get into the correct conference. \\n\\nComputer audio can be a pain as it pick up a lot of background noise and there is usually an echo\\n\\nThe leave meeting button should be easier to find and centrally located\\n\\n']\n",

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0Overall this has helped us to reach online students so they feel that we are real, live people and not just some robot behind an email address. Being able to video chat on a platform that doesn't really have technical difficulties in using has been a huge help for those that are less comfortable with sites that we typically use to video chat or host webinars or advising groups. I think that the ease of use in learning how to  operate a zoom meeting is a big pro. Additionally, this has completely changed how we can work with candidates who aren't able to attend on campus interviews in our actual physical space. This is opening up a lot of possibilities for us!\", 'Pros:\\xa0This product is essential to our team. We use this for a variety of reasons which to name a few include: communicating with students for advising or progressions meetings, communicating with fellow staff members or team members who are working remotely or telecommuting, communicating with faculty who are out of state, hosting large school or department/college meetings to allow multiple staff or faculty to \"remote in\" at the same time so even though they are not physically in the space, they can still see and hear what is going on in the physical meeting and we can hear them and see them as well. \\nI think this is a great concept for smaller meetings where we are all remote as well. It\\'s kind of hard sometimes to schedule up conference calls and being able to use personal laptops or work computers to video chat with a smaller group has allowed us to stay more connected. As an added bonus, it really puts a face to faculty that we really see or who are out of state so we don\\'t ever see them physically on our campus. It helps to create a sense of team and unity when we are all so far apart sometimes.\\nThe pricing options are AWESOME as well! The service teams have been great about working with us to switch things up or bump our plans up as well. The video quality for what we get, even with internet/bandwith problems has always been top notch too, which I really love. \\n', 'Cons:\\xa0No complaints! Their site is easy to use, their service teams are quick to respond, and there are multiple pricing/package options for you to be able to customize what you need for your uses. ']\n",

      "[\"Overall:\\xa0There are so many features that we love about Zoom. Such as the ability for each member to be able to share the information on their screen with the entire group so we are all able to see what they are working on or if they are having any issues that need to be addressed. Also love the ability for the meaning host to be able to mute or unmute individuals microphones in case they have forgotten to do so and there is background noise that is interfering with our presentations. As well as the option for individual members to either use their video or not, because let's face it, some mornings while working remotely, you just started ready to be seen by a bunch of people right after you've rolled out of bed and before you finish your first cup of coffee. It truly does have an option for everyone. Now that we have it, we can't imagine how we lived without it.\", 'Pros:\\xa0Zoom has changed the way we do business. We are a small company of independent contractors living in different states across the country, and it has never been easier to get us all together for a face to face meeting, brainstorming session, or just a Friday get together. It has brought us closer, made us more effecient, and has put a face to the names of people we have communicated with interoffice on a daily basis via email, phone, and text. Could we have continued are work the old way? Sure. Would it have been as much fun, no. We absolutely love Zoom.', 'Cons:\\xa0Personally, I think there Zoom platform works great. We have had a few issues every so often sending a meeting link and it not working automatically. But the great sing about Zoom, is the option to also send along the meeting room ID number and password in case there is an issue and people can easily login that way as well. So I would say, for a few extra seconds of typing in the meeting room number and password is no big deal and is not something that any of us have issues with nor do any of our clients. We love the fact that they are able to type in the information and are placed in a waiting room until we are all set and ready to begin our presentation.']\n",

Prior to that time, I had attended a handful of Zoom meetings which went fine, but didn't utilize a lot of features that we have come to rely on since we accelerated our use. \\n\\nWhile I did not use Zoom often for instruction (I do use it for private tutoring all the time), it was very valuable to me as a tool for collaboration. I sometimes attended 12 - 15 staff meetings per day on Zoom and without it, I don't know how we could have achieved as much as we did. Having the app on my laptop made signing in and operating Zoom super easy. The platform seems relatively stable, so most of the time reception was good and I love the ShareScreen feature. The ability to show my students various media really makes the biggest difference in their lessons.

You can set up a free account, and with the free account you can hold brief meetings (the last time I did this, the meetings were capped at 60 minutes). However, it is a nice and inexpensive way to see if Zoom might be right for you. My advice to those seeking a digital meeting application would be to compare Zoom side by side with GotoMeeting. As stated, my experience has been that GotoMeeting is easier to navigate and learn.  My team has used GotoMeeting for years, but even early on, it was easier to use than Zoom. ', \"Pros:\\xa0Zoom is a tool used mainly for online meetings. It's a great tool if you want to bring together remote employees. It's also valuable if you host a meeting and want to invite others outside of your organization without having to fly them to your city to meet in person. My experience with Zoom falls into this latter category. That is to say, my Zoom is experience is based on being in invitee to meetings hosted by other organizations that use Zoom. There are several features I like about Zoom. The audio quality is great as is the video quality. It's fairly easy to join a Zoom meeting (once you have the meeting credentials you simply click out on the url provided by the organizer). For audio, you can dial in or use your computer's audio system. \", \"Cons:\\xa0As an infrequent user of Zoom, I find it to be less easy to use than GotoMeeting (which is what my company uses). The Zoom interface is less clear, and it's not quite as easy to see who is in the meeting (whereas with GotoMeeting both of these details are quite obvious because of the helpful dashboard). With Zoom, I often find myself clicking around to figure out how things work. In sum, it's less user-friendly than other digital meeting applications I've used.\"]\n"

With powerful online learning tool, a teacher like me can do a handful of customization such as selecting the duration of the Zoom Meeting to identifying how many participants will be accommodated for a certain Zoom session.\", 'Cons:\\xa0For organizations who are into advanced software, Zoom Meetings is top of the line when it comes to its features. However, the general population, particularly the students, might find it a little difficult to navigate through the application. Newbies will find it hard to use it the first time because of some complex buttons, but using it several times will eventually help the users get the hang of it.']\n",

I do a lot of outreach programs and the pandemic complicated that but Zoom allowed me to host a ton of video meetings and do Point of View Microscopy outreach sessions by pinning certain hosts titles (I have 5 going at once).

Even  as a first time, it was great. I like those features like when you need to ask a question, you press a bottom to signify and everybody waits till you finish and your question is answered. Another feature i like is the ability to switch from video to audio or exiting the meeting at a point and joining later. You can even mute the app.  Zoom is almost like a physical meeting experience. It is an app worth trying by anybody with digital inclination and a desire for technological growth and improvement. Zoom is the meeting app of the future.', 'Cons:\\xa0My biggest challenge with using the app is the audio connectivity.

At the day/time of the meeting they can join in with just one click. It even walks them through the audio/ camera process. With other softwares we've had it could take up to 5-10 minutes to troubleshoot with the client to get them on the virtual meeting\\n\\n2) I love the ability to upload recordings to a cloud and send the recording (with a searchable transcript!) to the client via a shareable link.

We quickly realized that it could morph into a long term cost saving, productivity boosting solution. Our annual subscription cost is less than a quarter of what we budgeted for a single board meeting, including travel and lodging expenses for our members. Because of the drastic reduction in expenses, we are able to meet more frequently, accomplish more, and utilize saved funds for other endeavors.

Prior to COVID, this was a significant hurdle to handle the logistics of scheduling a date and time that fit 9 busy people's schedule. After the pandemic, it became an impossibility. Zoom gave us the tools to bypass the need for scheduling meetings around travel schedules and allowed us to continue business as usual throughout the pandemic. Moving forward, we have decided to maintain our virtual meetings indefinitely, because our board has discovered that Zoom leads to more productivity, more frequent meetings, and less cost to the organization due to no longer needing to cover travel, lodging, and meal expenses. \", 'Cons:\\xa0The only drawback for us is that the lowest pricing tier above free contains significantly more options than we require.

Another issue with zoom is the ui, specifically during screen sharing. It can be irritating to constantly have to move the box or panels that show up from zoom.
