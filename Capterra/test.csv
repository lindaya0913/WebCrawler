0,1,"“Most  simple, reliable and efficient meeting software ever. Experience meetings at its best! ”",I would simply say that it has been the software we ever needed. The new additional exiting and helpful features have taken the experience to new heights . Its simply the best.,"The simplicity and usability of the software,  the fact that users don't have to necessarily signup and login in order to attend a meeting (which made over 90% of my novice users  especially in remote villages). The controls well designed and implemented to offer the easiest way possible for users to use them. The meeting experience it offer in spite of slow internet speeds. The wonderful features that like chats, polls, break out rooms, third party integrations had given me the best way to have meetings. Zoom is the best software option for online meetings and is still the best option to use than in person meetings.",Background noise management is not yet so good though I assume that this is technically possible to achieve. Sometimes participant unmutes and attempts to speak with very high background noise hence causing unnecessary disrupting and distractions in the meeting. It would be awesome if there is a feature within the software to manage if a users' microphone background noise,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,Users will slow internet speeds had very horrible meeting experiences with other software's compared to zoom during tests. they would literally be kicked out of the meeting much faster and quicker than zoom does and it would be much harder to reconnect.,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,"Zoom is very simple to use, no need for sign ups and sign ins which is exactly what we needed for many novice IT users we had, User friendly interface and controls, Offers lots of very helpful and great features, Offered the bests meeting experience, reliability during slow connections, better waiting time for reconnections and rejoining meetings incase of bad network. Best reliability incase user changed their internet access connection."
1,2,“Zoom Meeting's review”,"The implementation of this software has allowed us to reach the international contact service by creating a safe platform to interact with our clients directly.  One of the most outstanding advantages of using Zoom Meetings at work is the high quality experience that  we create to our costumers by using the variety of tools provided by the software such as Applications, Remote Control and more. We are not hosts only if not problem solving people. 
","To begin, some of the features that are impactful for my job are the Screen Sharing, Screen Recording and the set of applicantions recently included. Furthermore, I consider the app is not so difficult to use. Actually, I got used to Zoom meetings  easily , so did most of my colleagues . I truly believe that the implementation of this tool in my job has helped us to create a direct connection with our costumers. ","Talking about the subject, I consider that the duration of the free meeting version for more than two participants  is too short since it lasts only 40 minutes. It should last at least 50 minutes.",,,Google Meet,"I think that what convinced me the most to purchase this product was the quality of video in every meeting that Zoom offers. Instead of Google Meet, Zoom does not decrease the quality of video or audio in some meetings when the participants are having internet connection problems. This is just because they don't want us to lose the connectivity between the participants in a meeting. However, this can be pretty annoying. "
2,3,"“After the pandemic, everyone in the field knows about Zoom, but many 'normal' people still don't...”","It gets the job done, it has many features, and has a generous Free plan for one-on-one meetings.
It has a general use type of service. It's like a reliable hammer - good for most things, but not good for many specific things. So if you need something more specific for your use-case, then there are other things out there that might be better suited for you.
Of course, if you just need something to throw a presentation every few months, or every now and then, then it's pretty good for that. Although the price then doesn't justify the low use case for the presentation side. And if you're just in it for the one-on-one side, then you have better options if you're willing to invest and if the cost is justified for you. But at the same time, if you only need it a few times a year, then Zoom or Skype can get the job done in a reliable way.
So I would say, don't dismiss Zoom, but don't fall in love with it either, if you're doing frequent presentations. ","The free plan is pretty generous with up to 100 participants for 40 minutes. It's great for many small-purpose presentations, but don't get extended with Q&A.
Mostly the free plan is great for one-on-one since it's not time-limited. It integrates great with WordPress through many plugins, or Book Like a Boss, CalendarHero and some other scheduling tools.
The quality of audio is good most of the time. Same as for the video, good most of the time.
The added advantage is that now, with the pandemic, it got more press and more people learned how to use it as well.
","I don't like the fact that software needs to be installed. It does have a web version, but even then it's less reliable.
It requires a learning period to get on how to use it. If you have a co-host who isn't familiar, it becomes an embarrassing trip to start teaching them in the middle of the presentation.
Many times, when I was a participant, not a host, I could see the hosts struggling with settings and getting things to work. Some hosts don't even know how to mute participants so it gets very distracting.
It often glitches due to either the internet connection or some other reason, but I have a very fast internet speed that doesn't present me any problems in other tools.
Some things about the tool aren't intuitive, and they haven't fixed them or changed them at all, in all this time, and I'd imagine, a huge amount of feedback. 
Since it's mainly software-based, people with Windows 10 S will not be able to use it, and you'd have to instruct participants how to ""Join from browser"". If it just you, one-on-one it's no big deal, but when there are more participants, each having their own problems, then you've got a problem.",,,,
3,4,“Click and start!”,"I have had a few techno-phobic clients and even they managed to get going on Zoom without much fuss. 
 It's empowering people to get online in a time when they don't have much other choice.

5**** for usability!  I've used this in multiple conferences, work meetings, and webinars.  This product totally wins out on ease of use for me and everyone using it!","Most people have heard of it and been exposed to it.  It's fairly quick to get on for the first time, and doesn't restrict you to a particular email address. ","Moderators for big groups could perhaps be a bit smoother.
The login doesn't remain on chrome so I struggled for over a year with which identity was popping up.  I have 2 businesses and a personal account.  I often ended up with the wrong one being displayed, even if I logged into it first.  The separate chrome identity's seems to have solved this, but it is a little annoying to have to login to a different chrome session (I often rush to a zoom session at the last minute).  Would be nice to just have a drop down to select an identity on one platform instead of completely separate logins.",Google Meet,"I chose this over google meet for a few reasons:
*User access wasn't restricted by a google account
*Many people have been socialized to it
*Even my non techie clients didn't panic about getting going on it for the first time.

Even through its not as integrated with my Google accounts, it totally wins out on ease of use and accessibility to the non google public.",Google Meet and Google Workspace,"When using Google Meet I didn't realise it was restricted to user accounts (before I upgraded).  I was very embarrassed to cause such distress to webinar invitees who couldn't get in and panicked about forgotten google passwords.

Tiered services are fine, but the way you manage it is much clearer.  You can pick a certain tier (e.g. limit of 100 people), and they can all access it very easily.  There isn't some hidden payment tier that was accidently missed that could affect your business."
4,5,“Zoom- Clear audio and HD Video Calling Features with Virtual Background  ”,"Zoom has the best video conferencing, online meetings tools for all sizes of businesses. We can make high quality video or voice calls anywhere . It is simple and easy to use, has no gimmicks, and is completely secure. With Zoom's recording feature, We can record all of our meetings for training, compliance or archival purposes. We can also invite people directly into a meeting by sending them a link that lets them join instantly. Whether the team is large or small.  We can easily set up a meeting with a single click-and, of course, handle it more professionally than ever before. Zoom's HD video and audio quality ensures that we will be clear and confident during every call. And with built-in collaboration tools, including instant sharing of our computer screen, we'll have no problem getting our point across. If we prefer to collaborate from home rather than at the office, this is the perfect solution for small meetings and conference calls, and even larger ones when necessary.","Zoom is the clear choice for video conferencing and Business meetings with advanced background. Zoom's built-in team collaboration tools make it easy to share files and ideas. Zoom works better than any other video meeting solution, including Skype for Business, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts Meetings. Zoom is used by millions of people like me to host business meetings that are more engaging and efficient than ever before.",No problem to use zoom for business meetings. It is a perfect tool and we can access it on mobile and desktop. ,,,Google Hangouts,"Zoom has advance feature to do business meetings. When we call to our clients than we required to share computer screen. In other software, It is not easy to work like zoom. "
5,6,“Best video conferencing software out there”,"The company I work with is a school, so when the pandemic hit we had to quickly adapt and make the switch to online classes. Zoom made everything easier, having so many features it was easy to adapt our classes to the virtual environment. Something else that sets it apart is that it's so reliable and its video conferencing quality it's so great. When dealing with over 300 people attending a class, I need to know the platform won't disappoint - and Zoom definitely doesn't. Over a year using it and it has never given us any problem.","There's no one software like Zoom, it's definitely the best there is. It has great features such as private chat, rooms, voting, polls, reactions, recording, and so much more. We use it as a platform for online classes and it's just amazing. The host has complete control of what guests can and can't do, which gives you much more confidence in hosting meetings. It's very reliable and has so many integrations. Also, I believe it's a versatile tool: you can have meetings, use for remote work, for hangouts with the team, online classes, collaboration in different groups, streaming to Youtube and other platforms, webinars - just to name a few.","Being the best in the market, the price is quite high for it. For companies, it's definitely worth it considering all it delivers - but I wish it could be more affordable so more people would have access to it, especially to use it for personal life as well.",Google Meet,"The video conferencing quality wasn't as great and reliable. The quality would significantly decrease when we had over 50 people on a call (something that with Zoom doesn't happen). Had to keep asking people to turn their cameras off, which was frustrating. ",,"I had heard about Zoom and its features. When I used it as a trial, I knew it had to be it."
6,7,"“Zoom Meetings, your virtual conference room”",My experience with Zoom Meetings has been very pleasent. It helped me (along with thousands of others) to get my lectures and complete my study from home during the lockdown period caused by Corona pandemic. ,"Zoom meetings is a superb audio and video calling client. You can comnect with multiple people at a time using it. It allows you to hold meetings, conduct classes and lectures, and attend conferences and seminars virtually right from your desk and actually participate in it. Participants can share files of different formats with each other in it. Also its screen sharing feature allows a participant to share his screen with other participants of the meeting when discussing a document or slides etc. Zoom meetings is equally useful on both computer and smartphone platforms. It also has a free version available for those who can't afford license fee, only with a few small limitations. ","In its free version, the meeting session terminates automatically after 40 minutes and you have to re-initiate the meeting to continue further. The video quality is sometimes poor on bad internet connection, which may be a result of its high bandwidth requirements. ",Google Classroom,I shifted to zoom meetings because our administration decided to adopt it due to its high accessibility. ,,
7,8,“Zoom Meetings.. ”,"I use to join university lectures on Zoom Meetings due to closure of on campus studies in wake of covid, so far I am very happy with it and love the way it works. ",Zoom meetings is mone of the most efficient and widely used virtual meeting software used now days. Even its free version allows scores of participants to join the same session. It provides the host with necessary controls like managing screen and muting mics. Multiple participants can talk at a time with out creating disruption in the service. The audio and video quality is good apparently due to low data requirements. You can easily share different sort of files with other participants. ,"It do not have any cons as such in the paid version, but in the free version the session ends on its own after 45 minutes, though you can continue by reinitiating another session. ",Microsoft Teams,I switched to Zoom Meetings because our campus decided to adopt it uniformly for conducting lectures and collaborating with teachers. ,,
8,9,"“Virtual Meetings, Virtual Smiles”","Zoom Meetings offers us many features for a good simultaneous transmission with other people around the world, giving us the ability to share our screen and that another person can use it, tools that allow us to make virtual meetings more dynamic, even if they have a certain limit of time and users if it is not a paid version, Zoom Meetings is one of the best applications to contact people from all over the world virtually.","Zoom Meetings is a platform for remote virtual meetings, which gives you many features such as wide user capacity, real-time transmission, tools for a good use of learning or work, screen sharing and many other things.","Zoom Meetings has few negatives as it mostly provides things for student and work use, but the things I don't like is that the price to expand meeting time and capacity is limited if you don't have the paid version.",Google Meet,Because  I see that Zoom is much more complete and has more features,,
9,10,“Best video conferencing in my experience”,,The video and audio quality seems to be consistently better than almost any other application.  Whenever there's a problem I blame my internet connection before I blame Zoom.,"With all the features that have been added over the years, its sometimes hard to find just the thing you want or need to do when managing a meeting or more advanced settings.  It does seem to have just about anything I've ever wanted at this point but can take me a couple minutes to find it sometimes.",BlueJeans,BlueJeans wasn't able to support big enough meetings to handle the size of our growing company.  Zoom has been able to handle company all hands meetings much better.,,
10,11,“Good but there is still space for improvements”,"Zoom Meetings are a good option for online courses and coaching. As a host is good for you to have some training to put everything right. There are many explanations and useful videos for the host and also attendees. I wish there was a special interface for the technical support, with a custom view and commands, that would be a game-changer.","I like the availabilities. The software is designed so that it can be accessed from any platform and even without installation. Here we come to the flaws that I will mention later. It has a good option for recording video content on the cloud, and it seems to be reliable and secure. Also, I like that there is a waiting room, maybe it wouldn't be bad if there was a branding option on the Pro plan. Chat is a must-have and has everything that is most useful for exchanging short messages.  ","There is always some problem with the mobile application during use, mostly with the sound. It often happens that the user does not hear the host. The issue is always on the user side, but still, I believe that some automation could change that the user has no inconvenience. E.g. that the Zoom application, through some authorization, automatically prepares the device for uninterrupted access to the meeting/webinar.
There is a problem whose cause is unclear, but on the screen is written -Please move this window away from the shared application (we solve that, but it's been annoying).
UI / UX should be better. For example, in the chat, if someone addresses me directly and I don't see that right away (except in the part where it stays ""Everyone"" and where the name of the person who addressed me will be written instead), I will not have a clear notification about the message that was sent to me privately. Also, the moment when the host starts sharing the screen with the full-screen option, changes displays on my screen to full-screen too.
As someone who has to pay attention only to the attendees, there is no clear display of everyone present and their camera/microphone status. There should be a quick option to mute the microphone and turn off the camera present without going first to three points, and then to the drop-down menu.  Also, when the co-host selects the option to mute everyone, it does not mute the host too.",,,3veta and LiveWebinar,"The Zoom first had everything to offer in one plan (chat, screen sharing, video cloud recording, waiting room, availability on many platforms). But, concurrent on the market is better now and promising in any way."
11,12,“The best virtual meeting room ever”,"Zoom contributed to solving the problem of scheduling meetings at times that suit everyone, as with Zoom, we can meet at the time we want, as we no longer postpone meetings because of the presence of one of the members abroad. Also, the feature of saving a recording of those meetings with audio and video, enabled us to use it as a Minutes of Meeting, which gives greater commitment to meetings that use the Zoom technology.","Everything is great and meets the ambition, I would like to thank the organizers of Zoom, as the efficiency of their product was evident, especially during the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Zoom was able to accommodate millions of virtual meetings, video calls and webinars at the same time and without any system failures or any technical problems.
We are used to Zoom, and it has become a part of our working day, as we are conducting meetings and interviews in the virtual meeting room provided by Zoom, which saved us a lot of time and effort and also enabled us to obtain information in a timely manner.
The application is very easy to use, whether from a mobile or a computer, where, after logging in, you will go to the interface of the program, where all the commands and services are cleared, where you will be able to receive an invitation or request hosting at a specific date and also set up a history of communications and contacts.

13,14,“excellent choice for meetings”,"Zoom works with each a PC and a smartphone. The utility is notably smooth to use. Meeting connections make it smooth to enroll in meetings. Chat, display screen sharing, file sharing, and whiteboarding are most of the functions. I can not consider any apparent hazards to using the tool. The uncertainty round information safety claims frustrates me the most. Since the start of the year, there was enormous complaint that Zoom has furnished 1/3 events information with out settlement and that positive additives of the tool, together with tracking the participant's interest with out previous consent, represent an invasion of privacy. ""","Zoom is used for our normal meetings. We use display screen sharing offerings to talk about initiatives and cooperate on topics. We use the whiteboard device to proportion our ideas. Zoom handles gradual Internet connections admirably, making it our go-to app for on line meetings. What I like great approximately the device is its common performance, which gives HD audio and video high-satisfactory at the same time as streaming smoothly. This substantially improves the entertainment of the use of different functionalities. This capabilities display screen sharing, assembly recording, stay polling, and plenty more.","The assembly UI seems to be a bit stale. The hyperlink often hangs. As a result, your most effective choice is to disconnect and reconnect. There aren't anyt any state-of-the-art capabilities, consisting of computerized connection to conferences primarily based totally on a schedule, or something of the sort. The price-overall performance ratio degrades whilst license call for will increase or capability is expanded. It isn't usually clean to reconcile them with facts security.",,"due to the fact it is smooth and free, however its competition are making movements to trap up. ... Zoom's discovered huge achievement in the course of a darkish time for the world, and it will try and keep that position, even though doing so would require prioritizing consumer privateness and protection over ease of use.",,
14,15,“Honest Zoom Review 2021”,"Zoom in my experience is one of the most complete and the only tool which strive to simulate the real-world meeting experience as well as solving the usual hassle when conducting and planning a meeting.

Zoom's video conferencing and online meeting solutions are ideal for organizations of all sizes. Anywhere, we can make high-quality video or audio calls. It's has the best user experience as well as a great user interface design. We may record important meetings using Zoom's recording capability for training, compliance, or historical needs. And in my organization we still have actual recorded zoom trainings which new staff can go and view anytime, thus saving the time, effort and cost for having another training. 
","Zoom Meetings is a fantastic audio and video conferencing application. It allows you to connect with several people at once. It lets you to arrange meetings, conduct lessons and lectures, and virtually attend and participate in conferences and seminars straight from your desk.

Also, Zoom lets you to feel more at ease at appointments, enhances interactions with possible clients, and allows you to be at work without actually going to work physically, as well as have productive conferences.

Moreover, zoom made communication simple, especially during the start of the pandemic. Over the last year, they've developed security elements that have proven important in preventing 'zoom-bombers.' I like the features and it is a great experience working with zoom for my weekly meetings as a cyber security manager. 
In my opinion zoom outperforms Skype for Business, GoToMeeting, and Google Hangouts Meetings in terms of video conferencing. Thousands of individuals, including me, utilize Zoom to host  productive technical meetings than ever before.","Most of the features for zoom in my opinion are perfect, the user interface is very user friendly, however, ""upon  sign on to a meeting you are not connected to the audio and it would be nice to have a built in computer voice with an button which could actually tell the other guy to please turn on his mic. ex: ""please turn on voice chat"" when pressing a button from my end.",,,,
15,16,“Wonderful Video Conferencing Application”,"My overall experience with Zoom has been great - I am able to work efficiently with my coworkers, I am able to send meeting invite links quickly and simply via email, and I am able to work on the go with the mobile app, which lets me join meetings wherever I am. Simply wonderful.","Some of the facets which I like most about Zoom Meetings include its ease of deployment, (meaning everyone has a relatively simple time getting acquainted with how to use it quickly), its screen sharing feature, which allows any meeting participant to share a slide presentation, for instance, and the fact that the software is available on both laptop, desktop, and mobile. Lastly, I find the stream quality to be absolutely phenomenal, even with relatively slower connections - it just seems as though Zoom figures out a way to make everyone's experience efficient regardless of how strong their internet connection is. Scheduling meetings is also very simple on your online dashboard.","There is honestly not much to dislike about this software outside of the fact that it might get a little pricey for those who carry out meetings with many, many people since that is when pricing actually kicks in, (meetings with only a couple of people lasting less than 40 minutes are complementary for everyone). The cost, however, should not be a barrier to anyone, in my opinion, since there are comparable softwares which charge more for a lesser quality service.",,,,
16,17,"“Popular, everybody has a zoom account”","Overall, I like zoom. I like to have only one platform used for every event, so it's good to use zoom since most people use it.","During the covid lockdown, we all worked and studied from home. Based on what I saw, everybody was on zoom. No one had an account and was ready to use zoom anytime. That makes everything easier. We can also record our meeting which I found very useful. The ""pin video"" is not a crucial feature but at some point adds a plus point. Could be useful sometimes. 
Zoom doesn't store much data too. For example, when we change our virtual background with a picture or a video, zoom doesn't actually save that background in it's own folder. But this could be a disadvantage when we delete the file (virtual background will disappear too). So far, I've never found any bug in it's system. No crashing, not many software updates.
We can also import an event from outlook, iCal, or other calendars which I find very useful. Everything is integrated. And you can block certain region to join the meeting. Privacy matters. There is also option to have the waiting room or not.","We can not use zoom web on our phone. We need to install zoom app to join a meeting. With the free version of zoom, we can only host a meeting or event or class for around 30 mins which is fair but yet annoying.
I don't know why, but the delay when using zoom is worse than another platform. So let's say when I try to say something at the same time with my friend, we won't be able to actually say it at the same time. There will be like 1 second gap.
When you use the raise hand feature, it's a bit difficult to see who first raises the hand and who's next.",BlueJeans and Microsoft Teams,"My company works with another company that has corporate account, so we are allowed to use that account.

Of course, if you only need anything to throw a presentation every few months or once in a while, it's perfectly adequate.

The platform itself has a suite of tools that addresses many needs and they are very amenable to updating and adding tools, as indicated by their users.  ","Zoom opened up a brand new way for us to learn and, sans the necessity due to COVID, I would recommend it for normal virtual learning and video conferencing needs because the platform runs smoothly and has everything that presenters and attendees may need.

I'm not using zoom to only serve my sometimes with my friends, I am also using the zoom on a business level to generate good revenue. I used to provide online services of youtube watch time and youtube SEO, but some customers ask for a live demo first. And for that, I use to schedule a meeting with my client firstly on zoom. And on the live meeting, I will clear him each and everything through my screen share, and in return, he will offer me a good budget.
Now if you also want to manage your business online or want to schedule an online meeting with your clients or want an online meetup with your youtube audience then definitely no platform is better than zoom. just download it free from Capterra and start enjoying a good life with zoom.","I liked the private chat and screen recording during the live meetings, too much.
No matter has many participants have been joined, I can always chat with anyone privately.
I can also send my message to all participants at once by going into the live chat tab. I usually do this, when I use to give live demo tutorials to my website users through the Zoom meeting app.
I always use to chat privately with my professor during my online class, because I feel shame in asking a question before while class. But with the use of zoom, I can ask as many questions as they appear in my mind.
And the second thing, why I liked the screen recording feature of zoom too much? The answer is so simple, I don't want to lose my client's trust and I also don't want to waste my own time. Because I can't offer tutorials to my clients, again and again, That is why I use to record my computer screen and upload screen recording on google drive and on dropbox.  Now whenever any of my clients will ask me for the same demo, I will simply send him a link to the previous recording.
And almost my all clients are totally satisfied with this method.","Actually, there is nothing that I found difficult to use or something least in this such amazing software. But I wish that there should be an option of Youtube Live streaming. I wish there should be an option too, There must be an option of linking google drive. Once live streaming or meeting is done, It should automatically upload the whole recording video to google drive for backup purposes.
Now talk about that why there should be an option of youtube channel linking? The reason behind this one is, this thing wastes a lot of time to upload a video manually on google drive and on youtube. But I have to upload these recording videos on youtube because I can't store such long data on my personal computer.
That's why I wish there should be an option of linking youtube and google drive or dropbox. It is not necessary to link google drive, I wish there may be an option of a cloud storage service to save our data.

If you are using your smartphone to participate in a meeting while driving with a hands-free kit, it is easy to use if you have a desktop or computer present, the connection seems more stable than other platforms for video conferencing currently available. What makes zoom so great is how portable it is. This application is lightweight and can be used on any device and browser. 

Zoom stands out from the rest of the typical video conferencing industry thanks to Zoom's ability to record sessions and control the screen during video calls. I use it both with a desktop computer and with a mobile phone, I definitely recommend Zoom Meetings as a must-have business tool.","Zoom has been my favorite video conferencing software for more than 2 years now and I can personally attest that it is one of the best software currently available. Integrated video meeting, voice, webinar, chat, and video conferencing services are easy, reliable, and innovative.

The software is constantly updated so you can work remotely even easier with versatile new features every day. By using it, you can perform the same tasks in a more convenient manner than you would have been able to do in person. It makes collaborating easier with colleagues or clients with features like a share-screen and remote access. 

We would face many problems without Zoom in today's COVID- 19 environment unless we were able to provide clients and colleagues with simple ways to communicate. Having the ability to send a link and jump into a quick call is very convenient and useful. Additionally, it seems to have a greater rate of engagement with our clients who are reluctant to give out their phone numbers but want to speak with us. It appears that many people already use Zoom as their platform of choice for calling or chatting even when we have other options available on the market.","Depending on the organization where your account exists, your zoom account may have many restrictions that the management puts in place and this can be frustrating at times.

This software is by far the easiest to use. I have used this with very technically advanced individuals, all the way to the tech fearful and challenged... and the experience has been extraordinary. It has changed the way I deal with people. It has added an ease to the meeting process and has enhanced the relationships that I have with people who know longer live nearby. It has unified my practice and helped us get to the next level. It's unfortunate that it took a pandemic to get everyone up to speed on video conferencing, but it is a bit of a silver lining in the sense that now people know how to connect with others in a much more meaningful way.

You've probably used it. Unless your business involves wrenches or blowtorches, odds are high you've even used it in the last year. If you haven't formed an opinion by now, then maybe Zoom isn't for you. But even if you have no need for it in your work life, there's no reason not to implement it into your personal life.

With Zoom, there's no reason to remain out of touch, as long as you don't have to touch anything. I mean, it's still limited to screens and digital representations. Not the best way to give someone a hug. But after a year of social distancing, are hugs even still allowed? Might have to ask that animated cat for advice on that matter. But hugs aside, Zoom is the perfect way to talk to someone when you can't be there in person. And if you don't want to talk? There's a convenient button that turns off your camera and microphone. ""Technical difficulties! I can't hear-""And he's gone. Zoom!","Everyone uses it, so if you're having trouble getting started, it takes no effort to troubleshoot it. It's also perfect for free communication, as long as you're not hosting a group chat (more than two participants). If you're the host of a group chat, you'll need to either watch the clock or your wallet, but even then it's affordable, especially if you're using it for business. It might be less profitable to pay for a service to host a chat where no one is earning for the team, but Zoom still lets you have that group meeting (sometimes for free if you keep the session short enough), and if you happen to be conducting the kind of business that leads to profits, then the cost of that meeting shouldn't matter. Finally, it's really easy to connect to a meeting, and almost as easy to host one. Most of the time, it's just a matter of copy and pasting a link and clicking on it. But even if you have to sign as yourself or the member of an organization, it doesn't take much effort to get going. Just make sure your camera and microphone work. It's only as good as the equipment you use.","Other than the background effects being average at best, I don't have much criticisms against Zoom. It can sometimes be difficult to customize your view port, and scanning participants for the active speaker can be a challenge if your setup is confused. And screen sharing can get awkward when you have too many windows to choose from, or if your share space is too nested within a framework of open windows. But most of these issues are easy to overcome once you get familiar with the system. Like Google's technology suite, it's only as overwhelming as the first time you use it. Once you've explored what it has to offer, you'll find it's pretty easy to use.",,,,

It has made communication with field teams much more productive and helped us save considerable time of field monitoring and visits.","The virtual backgrounds and filters always added a  touch of fun to our video conference meetings. In terms of more useful features, there are just too many to choose from, but one of my favorites has been being able to share my presentation slides as my virtual background. Also being able to record meetings and generate near-perfect transcripts saves us a lot of time and money otherwise spent on secretarial services.",There should be more lower video resolution options available to allow for easier usage in areas with low internet connectivity.,Anywhere365,"There seemed to be a mass exodus to zoom that happened at the same time.

47,48,“Benefits and struggles of a daily user of Zoom”,I use Zoom every single day. I used to use it at my previous job as an IT specialist and now i use it with my classmates as a student. ,"I have my possible group meetings in contact groups so it is super easy to call everyone at the same time, without having to invite each person individually.
We use the screen sharing feature the most, being able to see what the other is doing, to know where the mouse is clicking and in case we need to help, we can control the other person's mouse.
What makes zoom different from the other softwares (which isn't a huge deal but clearly makes the difference) is to be able to see the other people in the conference, even when i have another program open. It allows me to work on my project while still being an active member of the meeting with no issues.","The video quality, compared to other softwares (using the same camera without changing the settings) is lower.
When i enter a new meeting, i can choose to have my camera on or not but i can not choose the same for the microphone. When i have a meeting with my classmates and coworkers, i want the microphone on, but when i am joining a class, i do not want to disturb and have my microphone.
When i am the host of the meeting, i have to either wait for everyone to join and allow them individually or disable the waiting room manually. On top of that, if i have another program open and zoom minimized, there is no notification (not sound nor visual) that someone is trying to join the meeting, so i have to constantly check until everyone has joined","Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and TeamViewer",the screen sharing options and the possibility of opening another window while still being able to see the meeting and participate in it.,,
48,49,“Zoom: an expensive version of Skype”,"My overall experience with Zoom meetings has not been the best. Whether I'm having an audio problem and sound like Darth Vader or whether I cannot pay the full version and my time runs out, Zoom is just a software that can be replaced with at least four other software and for free.

I'm not going to tell you not to use it. If you have the money to pay for a full version and you don't experience the same audio problems I have, so, go for it and tell your friends you are able to have video calls in an expensive way, maybe just to feel a little better than them. Which, honestly, you shouldn't. ","I'm going to be very honest. There are several softwares that offer what Zoom offers, but for free. I can't mention any pros over any other software, such as Skype or Microsoft Teams. Don't get me wrong, Zoom is a very cool way to communicate or present a class or conference, as long as you pay a full version. Of course, there is a free-trial version, in which you have a limited amount of time per call, which is a little annoying if you need more time.

There is particularly a characteristic that I really enjoy in this software, and that is backgrounds. Of course, this trait is now available on other softwares, but I first enountered it here. So if you enjoy changing backgrounds whil you're in class or during a meeting, just for fun, you'll enjoy Zoom.","Honestly, Zoom is the rich people's Skype. When I think about it, because my bosses use it for their meetings, I'm like... wait a second... they could have this exact same meeting on Skype and for free... Then I remember... oh well... they just don't know what to do with their money. So yeah.

I understand the necessity of different softwares for communication during quarantine, and that teachers and students want to use the best and newest technology for their classes, and so on. But, let's be frank, spending money on a software that does exactly the same as your WhatsApp, Skype, Teams and also Facebook, it's just questionable.

Now, the worst part, for me, about this software is its audio fidelity. If you are wearing headphones that are slightly non compatible with it you will sound exactly like Darth Vader during your video call, and that is just really embarrasing. I have experienced this issue at least three times and I have seen it with other people. And when that happened to me, fortunatelly, I was in my laptop, so I was able to remove my headphones and just use the normal speakers. But if you're in a PC, there's no way to fix it. So... if you're paying for a video conference software and you can't even talk, then... what's the point?",,,,
49,50,"“""Zoom, Our Favorite Business Meeting Place""”","Its been a great experience using Zoom. We love it. The waiting room is a good feature, as it allows the host to choose who to admit to the meeting despite them having a link to the meeting. It ensures that no intruders participate in the meeting in the event that the link is accessed by some unintended audience. 
Our use of Zoom increased during the lockdowns and stay-at-home period due to the Corona Virus and I can foresee it going on even post-pandemic.

","I have had a great experience with Zoom since I started using it. It is easy to learn, deploy and use. The mobile access makes it all the more attractive. One can host or join a meeting from anywhere using their phone. Screen sharing, company branding, cloud storage, and local recording with transcripts are really great features.  I love that camera and audio are off when one is joining a meeting and they only turn them on when they are ready to participate. 
Zoom has really revolutionized the way we do meetings, especially in the last fifteen months when remote working became the norm due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. ","The only concern I have is on screen sharing, other portions of the screen that you did not intend to share become visible. When working on sensitive information, I will sometimes have to close everything else and only remain with what I intend to share which is too much work. Also, sometimes it can be heavy on the computer but it is manageable.",,,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,"Ease of deployment, widely available, great features, good customer support, and training available.

As a freelance writer, Zoom Meetings enables me to hold virtual meetings with other writers and discuss important things about the industry trends, effective writing technics, among other things. During such meetings, we can perfectly share screens, files, and texts without interfering with the quality of the presentation because voice and video streaming are perfect.
Additionally, as an academic and web content writing trainer, Zoom has enabled me to survive during the pandemic because I could perfectly conduct online classes effectively. My students enjoy it because they can also record the presentations/tutorials for future reference. Thus, Zoom company offers highly competitive pricing that conforms to the ""value for money"" analogy.
Finally, as a socially responsible company, Zoom offers free subscriptions for individuals, start-up businesses, small schools, among other individuals or organizations in need. Personally, I started with a free subscription but later upgraded to premium packages because of the effectiveness of the digital communication and presentation tools it provides.
I don't think, there is another better software for holding virtual meetings and conferences than Zoom. I would recommend it to everyone.
","There are two things I think should be improved. Firstly, the software should be optimized or refined so that it can operate equally well even when the internet speed is a bit slow.

Being able to have a standard meeting ID that you can use time and again allows us to easily share the link and password to our participants, rather than having to hunt for the unique link every time.","The biggest issue we have had with zoom is in its breakout rooms feature for large audiences. The idea is simple and logical, before the event, you can pre-assign individuals based on their email address to specific rooms. We used this feature for our first virtual Gala dinner in September of 2020. We purchased the large audience upgrade as well as the breakout room feature. We set up around 10 rooms each with at least 8 people in them in hopes to create the ""table"" feeling during our gala event where our room hosts could have their own invited guests join them. Unfortunately, when the event began, the breakout room feature failed and no-one was pre-assigned.

Through this, we have been able to even cater for the needs of the hearing impaired through spotlighting of sign language interpreters which was not possible via Microsoft Teams. ","I have been using zoom Meetings for my classes and webinars. I like it that I can raise my hand to object, ask a question or give feedback. 
Through the chat session, I have been able to connect with my classmates. Clarifications on class assignments have also been made via chats.

The basic subscription, which allows for 40 minutes is barely enough for a meeting. 
It reaches a time, when the app freezes, which makes it difficult to know if its the connectivity has issues or its the app. If at all screen sharing is happening,  it leads to the audience lagging behind and missing out on important information.

","The default benefit is that you can do face to face meetings through Zoom. At the same time however,
you have the ability to NOT use the camera if you chose not to. A Added bonus is zoom over a
phone call through the mobile application edition.  You can share your screen with your employee(er) your students, it is easy to walk them through the install on the computer/mac. You can collaborate and share your screens to review and go over Business, or Class lessons or check out projects you or they may be working on. ","Zoom allows users to  share the entirety of their computer monitors, or a portion of their monitors, or specific program windows with other users in the same session/meeting. However there have been discussions that for a brief moment, the monitor itself as a whole could be visible a Zoom user sharing the monitor intends that only sections of the  monitor to be. That means any user(s) recording the session could be able to take snippets or even freeze frames while doing playbacks and viewing possible potential sensitive information about user/company. Which is something to think about from a business standpoint. From what I have read so far from Zoom is that they are saying it is working on addressing the problem. While at the time of this review, the issue was still present in the latest version of the Zoom desktop client software for the Windows side of it currently. ",Microsoft Teams,"I found it less taxing on a PC than Microsoft teams. It appears after time that Microsoft teams starts to eat at the memory processes and starts taxing on cpu cycles  which zoom did not.  Zoom doesn't seem to be a resource problem that Microsoft teams is. Fun to use, compatible with most video setups out there on the market currently and even retro-wise as well.

It's incredibly easy to use at a moment's notice, when integrated with Slack you get the option of calling people through either Slack or Zoom, it's typically quite reliable in terms of service, and has helped us maintain a level of connectedness since we moved to working from home last March. I also enjoy the option to pick which locations to include dial-in numbers for on the invite as my company is world-wide. It's been a fantastic platform to conduct meetings from. ","Honestly, I think the functionality is my favorite part of Zoom. It integrates into Slack and Outlook, it's easy to use even for those less tech-savvy, the desktop app is wonderful for reminding you of upcoming meetings and makes it easy to schedule through Outlook, Gmail, or another calendar, and the Zoom settings when in a meeting are easy to use as well. The background options are both very helpful and fun, including the ""blur"" feature which I love. There's even an option to ""touch up your appearance"" which is wonderful when sitting in front of a camera all day. Additionally, recording is very easy to set up, even when I'm not on the call, and I love the feature of Zoom transcribing recordings when saved to the cloud. And the customization and preferences for each function are greatly appreciated as it's able to be customized to just about every preference you might have from the way the videos are recorded, to default settings for audio and video.","My least favorite aspect is the Outlook plug-in for Zoom. This is just based on my personal preferences, because the functionality itself is great; however, I like the body of invites set up a particular way and do not like how, when using the plug-in, Zoom auto-populates its own invite into the body. This just means that I have to create an invite, schedule through Zoom, and then erase the auto-populated body. I've actually disabled this plug-in due to it auto-populating each time I edit an invite and then will auto-send the invite, which results in me having to go back to fix it, and resend again. Now, I schedule directly through the Zoom desktop app and auto-populate that way so if I need to edit the invite, it does not auto-populate in the body of the invite.

The simple fact we can use this platform to connect and educate students in all different locations is a huge plus of the software. There are some pros to the platform such as breakout rooms that allow for small group discussion, a chat feature to allows a stream of conscious thinking from students, and the ability to put timers on breakout rooms as well as broadcast messages. The fact that the software is continually updated is another plus. ","There are SO many limitations to this software while trying to use it with students. The software was clearly meant for an adult work environment with quick meets and not used for all-day instruction so you can imagine it has many many limitations. Probably one of the biggest dislikes is, many schools and students have Chromebooks however not all the functions of Zoom Meetings work on the Chromebooks which can lead to many frustrations. The ability to communicate with just one student or one group of students if I am in a different breakout room is nonexistent which can be very difficult when trying to supervise or communicate a message. The lack of ability to just mute one student from using the chat can be challenging as sometimes just one student needs this ability removed yet it is an all or nothing for the class. I also don't like how I can't adjust the timer on breakout rooms, change names of breakout rooms, or add a room once they are open. This eats up precious time throughout the day closing/opening etc. There is also no ability to close just one room. I also can't save room titles from day to day which again eats up time when I am making the same four rooms for Reader's Workshop and Math Workshop every day.

There are a few things that, in my opinion, really sets Zoom apart from similar platforms.

First of all, there's its connection stability. I have tested quite many other solutions and none has had a stable connection as reliable as Zoom. 

Additionally, I like the fact that you can host and initiate, or participate in,  video or audio calls from either your web browser, the Zoom app on your computer or even on your smartphone or tablet.

It will be nice to be able to still see each other while sharing screen.","When changing the interface, i.e. share screen to not sharing screen, arranging sequence of participants, etc. are either difficult or not available at all.  Also, sometimes enlarging windows are very difficult, especially when sharing screen with meeting participants.  I do not like it that when we share screen, it is hard to see the other parties.  It will be nice to be able to still see each other while sharing screen and have the ability to enlarge participants video windows.

One other thing I do not quite like is that in order to change setting during virtual conferencing, I will need to jump out or find the main Zoom panel to make the changes.  It is not readily available while in a virtual meeting.

Zoom also does not work with Google Calendar very well.  Even though it offers the function to schedule a Zoom meeting and it asks whether you want to add it to Google calendar, this function has not worked for me!  I have been having to manually add the meetings I schedule which is not very effective and more time consuming.  

I hope Zoom will improve and become better and better and more efficient for a law office usage.",,Zoom had a promotional offer that was attractive and affordable for our office.,,"Zoom had a promotional offer that was attractive and affordable for our office and also while Google Meet was easier for us to schedule meetings with 3rd parties, some participants were having difficulties connecting their cameras with Google Meet; therefore, Zoom became a better alternative for virtual conferencing."
66,67,“Easy to use & learn”,Not being able to travel or be in close contact with people has been hard for my job but Zoom has changed the way i do training. I can pop in an office in Boise in the morning and one in Lake Chelan in the afternoon. The ability to reach so many people across our footprint within a matter of minutes has be such a huge help! ,I train people for a living and not being able to travel Zoom has been a huge life saver.  I love that it is so easy to use and  you can even access others computers if they are having trouble. Total game changer for me!,I wish you could create different templates with different settings. There are times when i want no chat and no Q&A option and others when i do but unless i go in an change those settings prior to scheduling the meeting i cannot undo them.  So template options or the ability's to change settings while a meeting is running would be a huge help!,GoToMeeting and GoToMeeting,"Zoom is much easier to use and to teach others how to use. I also like the integration with Outlook, the number of participants on the free account is 100 compared to 3 with goto meeting and scheduling a meeting in general is easier.

Great  product, highly recommend!"
67,68,“Zoom Excellence”,"Zoom has been a rocky road but where it's currently at today I'm very pleased to make the most out of it, on top of all of that I can use it for business or just to keep in touch with relatives especially during this pandemic and it's made a huge difference than the average phone call.","Great easy to use very reliably, I remember when it first came out it was a little buggy. Since then a few years have passed and gotten more into the business use of it and it just is a game changer you can see the other person in high quality, share your screen, and even set annotation to point things out. amazing! On top of all of that when it comes to business calls are very easy to manage and my clients can access them effortlessly which makes a huge difference since a higher close rate can be credited to face-to-face calls.","I'm usually very picky but when it comes down to this product I have 0 complaints, does as it promises.",Google Meet,"I didn't really switch I occasionally use google meet, although I am way more used to using zoom plus it's a lot easier to invite people, especially when you have an account and it gives me full and total control over my meetings.",Google Meet,Easier to connect on an international scale and more present with my customer base and clientele. Apart from all of that the control Zoom gives me is a lot simpler and powerful than google meet.
68,69,“A teacher's perspective”,"Overall, I am a fan of the product (even if I am extremely tired of teaching through this medium-I know its temporary).  I have used Google Meet (incredibly glitchy and very limited), WEBEX, though admittedly my familiarity is limited here.  Zoom tops them all in my book.  The embedded tools and ease of use with calendar invited and integration into my Google Suite makes it even easier to use.  ","Zoom is an easy application to use and navigate.  It allows a host of actions and provides a myraid of controls for the user/account holder.  As a teacher, it allows lots of controls for classroom purposes such as control of the chat function, and control of almost all user functions after meeting has started.  Of course, within the preferences, you can control much more of the meeting and its users prior to the meeting/session  starting.  It has become a welcome addtion for distance learning.  ","The two primary complaints have to do with the toolbar to do things like annotating a screen/document when sharing a screen or using the whiteboard function.  One part of that function makes some sense given what technical aspects.  You are basically layering something on top of a document, so if you move the document around on the screen the annotations DO NOT move with the document.  This is frustrating but understandable. Also, you have to close out the annotating toolbar to do other things instead of just being able to click on a different part of the Zoom session screen to perform that function.  By that I mean, WHen the annotate toolbar is open you cannot perform any other functions in Zoom until you close the toolbar function.  That is the frustrating part for this user.  My last complaint is more of a minor one at the account management level.  When adding alternative hosts as we often do for our district for substitute teachers, administrators, etc, you can just add to an ever-growing list.  You have to completely re-enter the ENTIRE list.  Our District IT team has repeatedly told us this is a Zoom issue, not anything they can control/improve on the District management end.  This is ridiculously time-consuming and needs to be updated.  I should be able to add a new alternative host simply by adding a comma and putting in the new hostname.  ",,,,
69,70,“Zoom Meeting Review”,The business problems I have solved using Zoom include the safety of employees and employers amidst the current Covid-19 pandemic. The restriction of travel in order to have an online meeting in the sense of following the WHO protocols amidst the Covid-19 pandemic has saved many lives. ,"Zoom has the capacity to hold huge meeting capacities and can be easily supported on Android, iPhone, Mac, iPad, and web platforms.

Zoom has impressive features which enable the hosts and participants to effectively participate in the sessions especially the emojis which are required for the meeting interactions. 

Zoom has clarity of sound and image, the audio and picture quality features can be improved depending on one's personal preference. ","Zoom should make it easier for the main speaker to be the main ""character""  and the size of the screen for them to be bigger and not to be small like the rest of the attendees in the meeting. Neither the Speaker view nor the Gallery view does this. It is difficult to determine who is speaking. 

Zoom should have a brief ""profiles"" option showing the attendees' brief biography and contact information if comfortable sharing as a form of networking.  It would be great to be able to click a button and switch between display names.

The time limit for a meeting time (45 minutes) in one session for non-premium members should be extended. ",,,"Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Anywhere365",Its efficiency and ability to maintain quality audio and video over the other products. 
70,71,“Work from home in a team with the right tool”,"Zoom offers us the ability to be flexible in today's modern lifestyle. It has a variety of features and integrations packed in - surveys, webinars, chat, private chat, connecting to the conference using the phone number (something a lot of competitors don't offer but is handy sometimes). Because of its friendliness to the average user and overall quality of video and sound, Zoom is the only choice that has all of the features that we are looking for.","As said in the title, Zoom is a must-have if you work from home in a team. In the time of epidemics, the noun Zoom has become as popular as the noun Google is nowadays - everyone is using it one way or another. And Zoom deserved this right way. With Zoom everything is simple and easy to use with a nice and simple user interface. Zoom allows you to communicate with your team like a champ. You can create breakout rooms where you split teams to do the job in pairs for example or you can even organize a public webinar that can attend multiple thousand people with no problem or lag.
I remember times when we tried another video conferencing tool and it was an awful experience a few years ago. Everybody could hear echo and the quality was not so great. With Zoom and smart algorithms, we never experienced that and the only person speaking can be heard every time even if not all participants are using dedicated headphones.
One feature I especially like is virtual backgrounds. My room is a real mess when we work from home and I am frightened that if my coworkers see what it looks like that I might have some problems. With Zoom I just click one button and immediately I can be on a beach or even in space. It works well most of the time.","Pricing is somewhat in my opinion overrated if you are planning to use Zoom professionally. It features a free plan but you can have conferences of only 40 mins and with a limited number of participants. Also, sometimes recorded sessions take a long to encode on a local computer but maybe is that because of a little older hardware in my current PC I use Zoom with. I miss the feature to trim cloud recording. Sometimes I or my colleagues start recording a little too early and if they chose cloud recording there is no cloud trim function and then we have to download the replay and trim it manually and then upload it to some other service. Not a big deal but it would be a lot easier with few clicks.",,,,
71,72,“Best video conferencing available”,"Overall, really good! Connectivity can get wonky sometimes, but that's probably more to do with internet connections than anything. Like I mentioned, starting a meeting as a host is also a little less intuitive (or I'm just missing something obvious). But other than those things, I find Zoom pleasurable to use and easy.","Zoom has, by far, been the best video conferencing software I've ever used. It's not perfect, but it's far and away the best in terms of video quality, connectivity, ease of setup, and fun features. What I like most is the intuitive nature of setting up video and audio settings. It's simple to make changes to things like brightness or microphone volume, whereas with other video software I've used, I feel that I usually have to guess and search for those settings.","Zoom can be wonky in terms of starting a call specifically. For example, for almost every scheduled Zoom meeting that I make, if I try to start the meeting through the app, I somehow always end up in a different room than the one that my invitees are in. So, I usually end up just using the same link that I send to my invitees, which means our meeting usually has no host, but it works so *shrug*. Not ideal, but it's a workaround that hasn't proven to have any cons, so I'll take it.",,,Google Meet,"I also have used/looked at Skype in the past, but that option isn't showing.

I choose to use Zoom over these other options mostly because it seems to be the most intuitive and easy to use one of the bunch. Google Meet isn't bad, but since it's browser-based other complications sometimes come up with that. I like that Zoom is a downloadable application that's free and runs pretty well 99% of the time."
72,73,“Gets the job done!”,"Very positive! I use Zoom for 4-5 meetings daily, both hosted and attended, and find that it works quite well for the majority.","At this point, Zoom is universal enough that it's invaluable to be able to suggest a Zoom meeting with a client or even a stranger and know that all parties will easily be able to set up and communicate via the software. That alone is a huge strength! Thank you, Zoom, for normalizing video chat. 
The desktop interface is also very intuitive, which is a great plus. Setting up, joining, and leaving meetings is very straightforward, as is chatting nonverbally in the sidebar. Since these are the features most of my clients use most often, that's a win in my book!
On a personal note, I also greatly appreciate the new reactions feature. It's a great way for a larger group to participate and weigh in on a conversation without verbally distracting from what's being discussed.","Additional mute controls would be wonderful-the ability for a host to mute all if desired would help avoid the need for an additional admit moderating big calls. More importantly, though, I feel the phone interface leaves a lot to be desired. Flipping screen to screen to access features is confusing, and often this leads to clients who have joined a call via mobile feeling frustrated or embarrassed by tech snafus.
Along those lines, I feel that the decision to switch the ability to offer a dial-in number to paid-only plans was a mistake. Until the Zoom app is accessible and easy to use, dialing in is by far the most straightforward way for mobile users to join a Zoom meeting.",,Zoom was catered toward professional environments,Google Hangouts,"Another company hosted ours on several Google Hangouts meetings, and the tech side of things felt unwieldy."
73,74,“Great software but a resource hog on computers”,My experience with Zoom has been positive and nearly all users are able to use the software for our meetings. This has not always been the case with competitors where you have to fiddle around for 5-10 minutes trying to get your local software to work. ,"We use both Zoom for meetings and Zoom for phones. The meetings software has been fantastic for years now, but in the last couple of years it has become heavier and heavier on our computers. My MacBook Pro with 16gb RAM will start spinning fans during nearly every meeting. If you don't use an external mic then you will hear the fans spinning in your meeting!
The phone system integration is good and we use it everyday","Support has been an issue, especially on the phone side. We had one person who was moving phones and they removed a user and accidentally removed a phone number. The big problem is they deleted the phone number and released the phone into the general pool. This is a big problem that any admin can do this. Fortunately we were able to get our main number back but we did loose other numbers in the system.",,,Webex,"Ease of use, wide availablililty to other users, large adoption"

The ability to still be connected with each other allows me to continue growing my business and moving towards success. I would highly recommend utilizing Zoom Meetings.,The features I find most impactful is the ability to share screens. The option to select which window or multiple windows I want to share makes this software the best choice for me. The ability to have a free account is amazing to leverage for quick meetings with customers and is simple for customers to get started with.,The feature I feel this software is lacking is the ability to share a file while in a meeting.

I'm not able to do this and therefore I need to send the file separately via email.,Join.Me and Join.Me,Zoom is much easier to use than Join.me and provided more functionality.

75,76,“The Best Software for Online Meetings and Chat”,"This app is particularly helpful during the Covid 19 pandemic. Making business calls, setting up sessions, and attending meetings are all things I can do from home. This software has assisted me in saving a significant amount of time and resources. I'm overjoyed that it allowed me to have some fantastic meetings with no video or audio issues, and I'm overjoyed that I made the right choice by purchasing this fantastic service.","One of Zoom's best features is how easy it is to connect with others through video conferencing. It's perfect for seminars, online learning, and socializing. I like the feature that allows users to share their screen with others, particularly during meetings. This is essential for e-learning so students will be able to see what the teacher sees on his end. Not only that, but I really enjoy using the feature known as break-out rooms. This feature is essential for post-meeting conversations so individuals will communicate with one another unlike in a group, allowing for privacy.","The problem I discovered with the application is with the chat function. If a user disconnects and then reconnects, the message history is no longer available to them.",,,Google Meet,"Zoom provided all the necessary functions, such as excellent image quality, easy screen sharing, and sound sharing, for online meetings. Zoom also included a room breakdown feature which we thought was helpful for discussions on a group or one-to-one basis."
76,77,"“Easy to use, full of useful features”",Zoom is easy to use and you can tailor its features to your specific needs. The weak whiteboard is but a minor annoyance for a product that offers so much in terms of features and possible customizations. ,"The wide spectrum of features, functionality and settings you can tweak to fit your needs. With Zoom you can create sub groups using the breakout room features, create polls, share screens with or without sound, write or scribble in a whiteboard and much more. In terms of security, Zoom has evolved tremendously since the days the term ""zoombombing"" was made infamously popular: Now you can add a number of security features that allow for safer meetings, like waiting rooms, password protected meetings, and other measures. Zoom is also bandwidth friendly. The generated recordings are also small in size, another welcome feature.",The whiteboard can be a bit more user friendly and pack more features. Most of the time I end up using OneNote or Miro instead due to the limitations of Zoom's own whiteboard and how cumbersome it is to share that limited board in collaborations with large groups. ,Google Meet,Zoom has more features than Google Meet. At least the ones we need in our organization. ,Microsoft Teams,"Easier to use, more features and we do not need the extra features, as our organization lives and breathes in the Google Workspaces environment.

78,79,“Zoom Zooms Past the Competition”,I use Zoom daily as my primary online business video communication tool. I sometimes find myself using it five or six hours a day while working from home during the coronavirus pandemic. I also use Zoom casually in the evenings or on weekends to communicate with family and friends around the world. ,"I have found Zoom to be the most stable and the highest quality of all of the online video communication platforms. Zoom brings people together by putting video, voice, web, and chat all in one place. In addition, Zoom makes it easy to share a window, a browser tab, or the entire screen with others. Files can also be uploaded and shared. Virtual backgrounds make hiding a messy room easy and filters (Anyone care for a bunny nose and ears?) are fun for casual or online social-distance drinking.","My biggest complaint would be that if someone gets cut off in a meeting due to an Internet connection problem and reenters, then the chat history from before they got cut off will no longer be visible to them. There are also many options so, in the beginning, it might be difficult for a new user to find some of them. ",Google Meet,"I found that the quality of Zoom was much better and more stable than the other options out there. I think it is because Zoom Video Communications, Inc. is just focused on one thing, making a fantastic cloud-based video conferencing system.",,After using various options over the years I found that Zoom is more stable and the picture quality is significantly better than the other options out there. 
79,80,“Reliable cross-platform tool for video conferences and meetings. ”,"Zoom has been very useful for online teaching of both one-to-one classes and for group classes. It allows me to share my screen with a student, or see their screen and work on the same document at the same time. 
 
The ""virtual background"" feature is useful for times when we don't want other participants to see the room we are in. This helps maintain a sense of privacy as well. Zoom's virtual background is particularly effective and quite natural-looking. 
","Zoom offers a stable platform for online meetings . Over the course of hundreds of meetings attended by 5-20 participants, video connection and sound quality has been outstanding. Only minor lags have occurred. 
 
Multi-platform. Zoom runs perfectly on our member's Linux systems and, of course, on Windows and Mac systems as well. I particularly like the fact Zoom goes out of its way to support a wide range of Linux distros including Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, OpenSUSE, Oracle, RedHat, Fedora, Arch and Manjaro. Outstanding!
 
Offers advanced settings that allow the use of co-hosts, automatic naming of video files, accessibility of recorded videos.
The ability to save each person's audio track to a separate file is particularly useful when editing a meeting video into presentations.
","Zoom has been caught up in controversy over routing data through servers in China, but Zoom management states that this has been addressed. Much of the R&D and development is done in China which may be of concern. 
 
A problem we found was that unless the correct time zone and time is specifically set in the Admin profile, Zoom might save recordings with the incorrect date and time. Be sure to check this otherwise you'll end up with a folder full of incorrectly dated meeting files that will require hours of time to sort out and rename. (This happened to us).

81,82,“Excellent product! ”,"We started using this product about two years before the pandemic, as a replacement to GotoWebinar. The advancement in features and accessibility over the last year has been phenomenal. We have been able to stay connected as a team through the chat, which does not appear to have a limit on the number of channels we can create to navigate teams and collaborative projects. 

The meeting feature is used by our team for everything from actual meetings, to webinars and a statewide conference. Our colleagues used this platform for their national conference and it was great.
","The zoom platform is very easy to start using. The vast improvements over the last year are excellent! 

The ease of setting up breakout rooms, navigating all the features is great. The live transcript is quite accurate and can keep up with fairly rapid speech. We have also used the interpretation feature many times with great success. It's incredibly helpful we can also live broadcast to our social media platforms, YouTube, etc. 
","If your computer lacks RAM, or your internet is anyway lacking bandwidth the features will bog down. I have been kicked out of meetings due to the number of users on Zoom a few times. The IT team was quick to correct that.

82,83,“Best quality platform for lectures and courses”,"Zoom Webinars has made it possible for us to continue working during the Covid 19 Pandemic, and we are overall positively surprised how reliable it is even when we have more than 300 participants. We send out the invitation to hundreds of participants and almost a 100% of them log in to the webinar without any trouble. ","The quality of the image is significantly better than other widely used platforms like Google Meet, Skype and Teams. For hosting lectures, Zoom has all the important features needed: screen sharing, sound sharing, the possibility to see the chat even during screen sharing (which is not the case of many other well-known platforms). When we first started using Zoom, it was because of the ""break-out room"" feature, which we used for discussion groups. Another key point was the facility to invite participants to the meeting, and login is easy even for participants who are not too familiar with computers. ","Initially, several company servers wouldn't allow their computers to download the Zoom app, so many participants could not join the meeting. We had to send out special invitations asking them to join through their browsers instead - which fortunately was an existing alternative. However, most companies nowadays recognize the Zoom app as reliable, so it hasn't really been an issue lately. 

The automatic Green Screen function (that is, with any colored background instead of a real green screen) does not yet produce a convincing background. It works with a real green screen though. Also, the camera filters available are all very childish. It would be great to have filters for business as well, such as the possibility to modify the warmth of the colors in the camera picture or similiar.  

We mostly use the Webinar function, and it automatically keeps the participants´ cameras off and microphones muted - which is great! However, when we have tried to unmute a participants mic it has never really worked. However, this is not an essential function for our lectures since we use the chat function for discussions. ",,,,"It had all the essential features for an online lecture, with great image, easy screen sharing and sound sharing.

83,84,“Better balance between audio and video quality and ease of use. ”,I use Zoom every week for business meetings and to teach. I use the co-host role a lot so I can dedicate myself to my class while someone else runs the room.

It is easy to use for those who do not usually master computer tools, who will meet their needs. But it also has a variety of advanced configuration and management capabilities that allow you to teach or make professional presentations. Another great point is its audio and video quality, its possibilities to divide the meeting into small groups, use co-hosts who help to manage the room, etc ... ","The price can be limiting. The free version allows meetings of up to 40 ', and can be useful. And the $ 15 version has unlimited time and up to 100 people in the room. It is usually the most appropriate.

Very useful for those colleagues who are not very self-aware.

Secondly, the amazing screen sharing feature - where I can also give control to another participant over one of my open programs or my whole desktop, while conversing all the time. Talking about TeamViewer on steroids!

Another massive plus is that in the free version you get your own free meeting with a unique link and you can reuse it again and again.

85,86,“Great seamless features (but missing a few)”,Zoom has been a game changer and has elevated the classroom expereince.,"Zoom has a lot of great videos conferencing features. Reactions, virtual backgrounds, chats, recording co-hosting, breakout rooms. Whats even better, is the administrator of the calls has a lot of freedom for how to set up calls. You can have participants hidden to one another (like a webinar), you can have the chat disabled between participants or entirely. Even their post call features are useful. You can see who attended, you can password protect the recording, and you can have a transcription of the recording. I especially like that participants can call in with a phone, laptop, tablet, or any device.","While the features are all great, there are a few missing that would really make it the top conferencing option. One would be built-in meeting notes (like mircosoft teams). Another would be live captions for audio-impaired participants. And finally, I wish there was an option to reduce the quality of your video, because with higher HD devices, Zoom sucks all the bandwith of internet and makes it impossible for other devices to browse or stream. However for many meetings video is required so participants cannot turn off their video.",,,Microsoft Teams,Easier to integrate with existing users.
86,87,“Great connection!”,"I recommend Zoom meetings, it works and it's continually being improved! ","There are many benefits that Zoom has over its competitors, which I only started appreciating after adopting it as my primary video conferencing program. I found that Zoom connects well even when my connection is not that strong. If the connection is bad, I normally get a pop-up message letting me know that my connection is unstable. This is very helpful because I do not have to try troubleshoot while busy in a meeting. 
If my connection completely dies and I am booted out of a meeting, when my connection comes back I am seamlessly let back into the meeting without having to restart the session.","I feel setting up the mic and speaker could be improved, maybe by adding a quick guide within Zoom or a link to one. 

It would also be nice if Zoom could be able to pick up only speakers and mics that work? I have three speaker options and only one works but Zoom picks all three up, meaning I have to test my speaker each time I start it. The nice part is more often than not it remembers the speaker option I used the last time.

It would also be nice if there could be a Zoom call? not have all communication as meetings to be joined.",,"I became familiar with Zoom from working with different organizations that preferred it, I then started appreciating the advantages it has over other programs.

My targeted customers are mostly housewives who are fairly new to technology and apps. 
Zoom comes in as an easy access for them as all they need is just a click on their unique link which could easily land them to the Meeting room. 

Simple Register Page
I also like that I could create a simple lead page for my registrants. Although my company is not using that feature, knowing that there is such function which you can also personalize it with your own logo is pretty good as anyone who is trying to hold a  zoom meeting with some own personality can easily do it themselves.

Smooth Streaming
The streaming of zoom is also ne of the applaudable factors of this software. So far, with a steady Mbps on our side, the resolution and sound are just things you don't complain about at all.

Flexibility in Muting and Turning on Camera
As the host, we can easily mute our guests and turn off their webcam through the Zoom settings. And when it comes to the time to  interact with our guests, we can easily unmute them to speak! 

Awesome Customer Support!!
And I should say Zoom has great customer support as well. They are always on a standby mode ! There was once I was trying to look for my registration page but I failed so I quickly contacted the support team and straight away they came to the rescue and pin pointed my problem and assisted me that I had mistakenly unticked the registration box.
Very helpful indeed!","I have to hesitate here for a few seconds to actually think of the downsides. 
But they do have a couple of things that I would like to see that could be improved by Zoom.

The ability to save the CHAT HISTORY.
As we are trying to close sales through our webinar, and since there's no way to take down the potential clients who have responded in the chat, we have to manually write their names down to contact them once again without ending the meeting first. 
If only we could save the chat history, perhaps that would really help us a lot in following up with our potential clients. 

A short clip on how to turn on the camera and connecct the audio. 
Every time before we start our webinar course, we have to educate/inform our students on how to connect their audio. I will always be the one to teach the steps in utilizing the tools in zoom which would take up a good 10minutes. If only we had a short professional clip by Zoom to send to our participants, that would save up so much time!",,"I had problem in integrating our landing page to Webinarjam. As we had already installed our pixels in our landing page and we were looking for a platform where we could easily link with our webinar but Webinarjam could not offer that function. Hence, we switcted to Zoom and  used Zapier for the integration. ",,The ability to integrate using Zapier to cut off the manual tasks. 
88,89,“Virtual Learning”,Overall this has been a good option as our schools have moved to virtual learning. It is easiest used among adults and is very simple to use. ,"Zoom is a great way to connect with others when video and audio are necessary. It is great for meetings, e-learning, and social connections. I really like that you can share your screen. This is especially helpful for e-learning. It allows the students to see what you are seeing (and allows you to see what they are having problems with). I also like that you can split up into break-out rooms. This gives diversity of discussion. The administrator also has the ability to hop in and out of different rooms. As a teacher, this is a great way to get students talking while also supervising the conversations.","There are some difficulties with this software and e-learning. For example, the leader can mute all participants; however, participants can unmute themselves. This makes it difficult if you have a student who wants to interrupt the lesson. They can simply unmute themselves at any time. Also, while you can share your screen, every participant can also share their screen. If too many people try to share their screen at one time, it creates a bit of chaos and oftentimes glitches out the system. ",Google Meet,Zoom had better connections and easier starting and stopping the meeting capabilities.,,
89,90,“The Number One Online Meetings and Chat Software ”,"After all, I find the Zoom app very useful, especially during the pandemic.
I was working from home, and I needed to do some business calls and this software helped me to save a lot of time and money.
I'm very happy because it helped me to have some great meetings without any video or audio problems and I was very happy because I made the right decision by using this amazing product.
I will keep using it, and I hope the Zoom team will keep us updated and they will add more and more cool features for us.","I like it because it's one of the best free video conferencing software in the market.
It's very easy to use and has a lot of features.
I can have a meeting with 500 people at one time without any problem.
I can have a full HD call with 720p without any problem and the video quality is very good.
I can have unlimited one on one meeting with the free plan and no need to pay an extra charge. 
The audio during my meetings is clear, and I can also use a virtual background for privacy.
The user interface is easy to use and I really like it in both the mobile devices app and the desktop software. 
I like the screen sharing option because It allows us to share their screen to play a slide show or a video or teach our students with this option.
I like the speed and fast performance provided by this software and I like the camera and audio options too.
I like the easy invite URL code and I like the chat option too.
I like their high-level security, and I trust the Zoom team to protect our information from cyber-attacks because It's very important. 
I like their support and how fast they reply and they are there for us 24/7 and they have also a lot of tutorials and articles about many topics to help us.","I really hope they can allow us to delete inappropriate comments during the meetings.
I hope they allow us to do one-on-one meetings with the option of 1080p video quality.
Sometimes I get the camera really blurry, and I don't know why this problem happens to me.
They can also, add a browser extension so no need to download the Zoom app and install it. 
Sometimes the support team takes a lot of time to reply and fix our problems I hope in the future they can add a live chat option for us for a better experience. ",,,,
90,91,“Zoom make social distancing easier”,"I knew about zoom before this pandemic. However, I became a frequent user since the pandemic and the lock down. Apart from the few issues I had which most of them minor the software was quite useful and I benefited alot from using it. ","Being that our new normal at work is to work from home most days it made meeting much easier. I really love the fact that all we had to do is send a link for everyone to be joined without an hassle. Zoom can be used for multiple purposes and not just for meetings. It is used for online learning, preventing students to have to be face to face with their peers and their teachers. It is very user friendly. Another pro is that you can share multiple screens and it allows virtual background which is top tier. The virtual feature of hand raising is amazing Especially in schools and meetings.","Even though this software is on it's way to top tier there is still some areas that could be improved upon and they are:
1) it should be clear on how you turn on your mike
2) you have to upgrade to a paid plan to use customer support and when you do (at least when I do) there is no customer support 
3)there should be an option for you to share and communicate with persons you are waiting.
4)the virtual backgrounds could be a bit clearer or look a bit more realistic ",,I love that all I needed to do was send a public link to the potential participants of the meeting and they could easily be joined instead of asking persons for their user name. The maximum amount of persons that can join on skype is 50 and our organization is bigger than that amount. While zoom can accommodate over 50 participations and more than 10 screen videos at a time. I really liked that you can divide participants into groups when using zoom. ,,
91,92,“Getting Together With Zoom”,"Before 2020, I never expected to need a virtual meeting program. I was able to conduct much of my business with customers or clientele over the phone or in person. Now I feel like I can't live without Zoom. From virtual conferences to discussing illustrations with colleagues, it has become a necessity when we couldn't get together. ","Some of the better features of Zoom are the ease of connecting with others via video conferencing. The company keeps its software updated, and they do care about security. You can use the program for free and still get many options, such as unlimited one to one meetings, 40-minute meetings, and hosting meetings with up to 100 participants. There are nice video options such as screen sharing, virtual backgrounds, spotlight multiple people, etc. With a pro plan ($149.90 /year/license), you can have the ability to offer longer meetings (I encourage question and answer periods), streaming, and reporting functionality.","I recently found out that there are many people who still don't have access to a computer. Those that want to join the meetings can do it by phone, but it is cumbersome to connect. I had to snail mail the meeting information to a few folks so that they could connect to a meeting of mine, and I had a difficult time walking them through the steps.

The program doesn't let you sign in with more than one device. I wanted to troubleshoot the phone call issue and others myself but needed someone else's account to verify the solutions.

I also wish Zoom offered a simple blurred background option for their virtual session like Skype offers. I don't necessarily need anything fancy for a background. I just want to make my background less distracting, especially when my cat starts bathing behind me.",Slack,"Although Slack is good for sharing documents and collaborating on work projects, it didn't meet my verbal communication needs. I can still perform screen sharing with Zoom and let others see what I am working on.",,"Skype has always given me issues when it came to chatting. I looked into using the business version, but I didn't think it was worth the price and more people were already using and inviting me to Zoom meetings."
92,93,“A Lifesaver During Covid”,"Prior to covid I'd utilized zoom occasionally but not on the paid level.  I had to upgrade our usage to allow for more people to be included in meetings and my staff to utilize it as well for online library program offerings.  It's been great.  I can easily schedule a meeting, sent out notice to my attendees and even send it to Facebook Live so that I can still make my meeting accessible for public viewing.  (We're subject to open records laws)","Eight months ago Video Conferencing seemed like something that I'd never have to truly look into beyond an occasional use, more for fun, not really work.  The Covid 19 Crisis made me rethink that.  I'm the director of a small public library in Kentucky.  We are required legally to host monthly trustees meetings to keep tabs on/make the community aware of the utilization of tax dollars and services offered.  But what do you do when you can't allow those trustees to be in the same room together for the sake of their health?  Zoom really saved us.",I've not encountered any real issue with our use of Zoom thus far.  It's been easy to use for myself and the library trustees.,,We hadn't done the paid version of Skype.  So I can't say for certain that a paid level might offer more? But even at the non-paid level we preferred the ease of Zoom over Skype.  It just seems to be a smoother running format.,,"We thought about skpe but Zoom was just a better fit for us.  Low cost, easy to use, easy to share and manipulate by people even if we couldn't physically be there to walk them through how to join a meeting etc."
93,94,"“ZOOM for team discussions, learning and more!”","Overall, I had a good experience with ZOOM. Through the application we are able to have team discussions, discuss ongoing project, presentation and more. I am able to join live meetings in anytime and anywhere. With the remote desktop connections, we are able to access the office PC(virtually), and do works as specified. So, its been easier for us to 'Work From Home' in this pandemic.","Zoom is great app for online video conferencing. It Supports multiple devices, file sharing, video calls, texts(chats), screen hosting, remote access and much more within the single app. The interface seems smooth and navigation within the app is handy. Zoom has its own in-built screen recording feature, and users don't need to install any external softwares for screen recording. ","For most of the times, I am experiencing the repetition of audio as I speak. It's quiet disturbing when I heard my own voice repeling back. Also, sometimes, the calls ends out unexpectedly, and I am likely to miss important announcement and team discussions.",Join.Me,"ZOOM was able to provide all the extensive features we need at work, where other similar apps simply lacks most out of it.",,"Zoom was easy to use and implement at work. Even our IT assistant recommends ZOOM, for video conferencing."
94,95,“A very complete conferencing application that suffers from usability issues”,Overall I have found Zoom to be a stable and valuable tool. The pricing structure is reasonable and the features very complete. I like that the company is continuing on improving security which is imperative to it's continued use. I often recommend and use Zoom because of this.,"One of the things I appreciate the most is that only the host of a meeting is required to have a membership to take advantage of long conference calls. This has opened up the ability to use Zoom with a wide array of customers and use cases, such as adding family members. Zoom is also frequently updating their application to make it more user friendly and add compelling features which has made this conferencing tool a goto for nearly everyone. The fact it is completely cross platform makes it accessible for anyone I need to conference call with.","The inconstancies and the seemingly constant adjustment of features is a blessing and a curse. When working with others they often can't find how to do something that they ""saw yesterday."" While this isn't a major issue for professionals, it can be crippling and frustrating to non-technical users. Also, there is a level of inconsistency between desktop and mobile applications on the location of buttons and features that can make it very difficult to assist someone when providing them support. One other issues is the confusion of ""New Meeting,"" ""schedule,"" and ""meetings"". These names as well as their button locations (meetings) make it frustrating to schedule, or find a scheduled meeting. It seems ""New Meeting"" could easily make it optional on the dialog to make this a quick meeting vs. scheduled meeting. Even though I am aware of what these mean I am forever clicking the wrong button.",,"The pricing structure, ease of deployment, and reliability (not to mention the features) made it a very easy choice to switch.",Google Meet and Slack,"The cost, features, and ease of use made it an east and logical choice."
95,96,“Zoom- The best video and audio calling application for Business.”,"My overall experience with zoom has been really great since the software is very easy to understand as well as use and the speed with which is operates is really recommendable. Also, the screen sharing feature on this application is fastest when compared to its peers. Having said that, I would again like to reiterate that it is one of the best internet calling applications available in the market right now .","Zoom is one of the best and fastest audio and video calling software available in the market today. As per my understanding, the best USP of zoom is the simplicity with which this software is created and moreover the speed of manuovering in moving from one functionality to another within the software. I would also specifically like to mention the fact that while working on slow internet speeds, I have experinced zoom calls to be the most seamless and thus they provided a wonderful experience even in low internet badwidth conditions.","The only thing that I didn't like much about this software is the limited number of functions it provides to the end user. To elaborate, zoom is primarily used only for calls and chats. I wish i could have seen more features in this application like file sharing and editing on cloud, intergration and preparation of different types of office products etc. within zoom, that way we would not have to switch to other applications for these kind of tasks .",,"Skype for Business really became outdated over the period of time, there are various reasons because of which I make the switch and they are: Firstly, Skype for business is really slow in processing and performing day to day tasks such as finding a user in the company directory as compared to zoom. Secondly, during screen sharing, there is always a lag on the other side when we use skype for business and thirdly, it takes atleast 3-4 minutes for the application to get connected to its server and start operating. Clearly, I didn't faced these issues in Zoom and hence made the switch.",,
96,97,“Decent solution for online meetings”,We are using Zoom for our daily meetings for website development. We use the screen share features to discuss on the project and to work on the source code together. We share our ideas with whiteboard feature. Zoom handles weak internet connection very well - which makes it our on-the-go app for online meetings.,"Zoom can be used both on PC and smartphone. The app is quite easy to navigate. Connecting to meetings is easy using meeting links. It has the options to chat, share screen, documents and whiteboard - everything needed for team meetings. The Driving Mode is quite handy when only voice communication is needed.",The meeting interface is kind of old-ish. Lags quite a lot sometimes. Disconnects and reconnects again and agin on weak network. It doesn't have advanced features like auto-connecting to meetings according to the schedule.,Google Meet,,Google Meet,Zoom can handle weak internet connection better than any other meeting platforms. It compresses video and audio data on-the-go and adjusts with the connection quality.
97,98,“School's Solution During a Pandemic”,Overall Zoom is an amazing software and I'm glad that most teachers use it. I do think there are some improvements and some added features to be made. Zoom's a strong option for anyone needing to teach a class through the internet or host online meetings with international people and I believe it will become a better feature as time moves on.,"Zoom has been a great software for online meetings since 2013. Although only a couple of people had used Zoom pre-2020, it started to emerge during the time Covid-19 started affecting schools. Due to people having social distance, having school in-person was essentially impossible without getting sick. Zoom was a strong solution to this problem and is still being used more than ever today. Like most students, I have been only using Zoom as a way to attend school during this pandemic but I do not mind having online school especially since I know doing it may save my peers from contracting the virus. Zoom has provided a way for us students to attend school without having the risk of exposing or being exposed to Covid-19. Zoom's software is easily manageable as most people in my family could use it without issue. It's video chat software allows for the option to quickly turn on or off both your mic and camera in an instant. You can also message people through a chat during a meeting so there's no need to turn on your mic to ask a question. The quick command menu allows you to ask your teacher multiple things without having to get their attention while they're teaching. Accessing a Zoom meeting is also very simple as you can send or receive a link that will instantly put you into the meeting or enter the room code. Zoom has a feature where the host can send you into separate groups privately which is very effective when doing group projects.","Zoom has some flaws that other softwares already have integrated into their system. One example is Discord which allows the user to turn up the mic volume of anyone in a meeting while allowing you to simultaneously turn down the mic of someone else. Zoom does have to ability to allow you to add contacts but personally I don't use this feature because there's not a quicker way to do other than adding their email address. I think this takes too long and so, therefore, don't use this feature as much. Zoom seems to be strictly a video, call, and message application when many of its users are students and teachers. Integrating a feature that allows teachers to hand out assignments in an organized way would seem more beneficial. Also, it does seem like Zoom could add more features to make it seems like an software that's used more for than just school and work. It could add a social media feature, although this is a hypothetical situation, similar to Snapchat's ability to send pictures to anyone in an instant. Or add a stories feature where teachers can remind students that an assignment may be due while making it look more interesting than just an email notification on your phone.",Google Meet,"Well I personallly didn't make the switch but my teachers did. I believe it's because they figured that since most other teachers use Zoom, they wouldn't want to confuse their students by having them use more than two software for online school.",,
98,99,“Meetings during a pandemic? No problem with Zoom.”,"During the pandemic we needed a solution to hold our meetings for our offficers, general membership, and committees. We needed a perfect solution, and we needed it quickly. As the project manager on implementing and researching a viable solution, we looked at what we had, and what we wanted. We had GoToMeeting. I found that this product was clunky, not user friendly, and overall a hassle to implement and utilize for a wide demographic of members. Zoom to the rescue! When we priced our and made the switch, I went forward with looking for a solution that would appeal to those who know nothing about technology and computers. We found Zoom to be extremely user friendly for those people, and we were able to implement quickly, easily, and accurately. The feedback from our membership has been nothing but positive and excited to finally find a user-friendly platform that just works during this changing and uncertain time! ","Zoom was super easy to implement for our department of 200 plus members. This was by far the easiest aspect of the program. Zoom was extremely easy to price, and to roll out to our membership. We have a wide demographic of members, some who are computer-literate, and those who are not. What I like the most was being able to on-board those members who are technophobes. Generating and setting up a meeting was very straightforward, and incredibly easy. I can send a meeting to multiple people quickly and easily, with it being easy and simple on their end. The feedback has been nothing but positive. Secondly, I love the stable connection zoom provides, with crystal-clear audio and video when we run a meeting with over 200 people at once. This was spot on for what we were looking for. ","My only issue with Zoom is during rapid discussion. Sometimes the software has an issue keeping up, audio will cut out, and it is sometimes difficult to follow when multiple people are talking at once. This occurs only a few times and seems to be inconsistent. Sometimes it goes ahead with no issues, and there is no difficulty hearing, but sometimes it is burdensome to ask someone to repeat what they were saying and it slows down overall productivity and user happiness.",GoToMeeting,"We made the switch because after I played around and tested GoToMeeting, I found it to be heavy and cumbersome. The audio was not the best, and the overall admin settings and abilities were repetitive and burdening. Connectivity was also sometimes a problem, especially with non-computer literate members who were using virtual meeting hosting programs for the first time. In order to make it easy for our members, we did research, sandboxed multiple programs, and decided to go with zoom.",GoToMeeting,"We discovered that zoom was by far the most user friendly, easiest to implement, and simple to teach out. Pricing was right on point with where we wanted to be, and the a-la-carte options were what we were looking for. Overall we are very happy we went with zoom versus the competition in virtual meeting software. "
99,100,“Zoom Makes It Possible”,"Overall,  Zoom has provided that easy & seamless transition from 100% in-person work to now 100% virtual work in a matter of 2 days. Also, Zoom has been crucial to our ""office bonding""  since it has now been approximately 5 months of both seeing these coworkers. ","Back in March, like the rest of the country, I was sent to work from home due to coronavirus. Since Zoom was already integrated into our GSuite & used sporadically, it made it a seamless transition, most importantly our meetings that had already been scheduled prior to being sent home. Part of my job is recruitment & onboarding, and with Zoom, I have been able to successfully hire & onboard several new employees, specifically during this COVID time. When I have had to hire en mass, I like to utilize the breakout room feature when I have to virtually verify our employees' I-9 documents. The breakout rooms allow for there to be privacy when showing these documents on camera, reducing the stress & anxiety of showing these documents with strangers present. We have also created a biweekly talk show presented through Zoom for all of our employees to watch. Topics include, but are not limited to, features in Zoom itself, Google Form creations,  Google Drive, etc. Thankfully Zoom has made virtual HR as easy as possible. ","My biggest complaint about the software is that when connected via phone, people can sometimes hear themselves via feedback on their end - more so than on the computer mic. It is extremely important to ensure you are muted if you are not actively speaking while using the phone audio method. ",,"During our recruitment proceeds we used Skype for Business primarily, however, we were always running into technical issues regularly. ",,
100,101,“Reliable and dependable”,"We love using Zoom and it is very good at what it does but recently with all things COVID-19 related, they've focused on securing their platform and giving users the most secure and best possible experience during their meetings. Our dealings with Zoom customer support is minimal but for the most part, they're okay, not great. As we work as AV specialists, and we inform Zoom CS that we do, they still often do not refer us to their back-end engineers when we have more advanced issues, rather they direct us to their online resource library, which we are already aware of and consult first when we have issues. Overall, it's a good experience which allows an acceptable level of admin control and scalability, we're happy with what we have right now and we have faith that'll continue in to the future.   ","- The admin panel is clear and easy to navigate.

- Users can be grouped and customised to suit your organisation's needs.

- A lot of online resources exist to help troubleshooting and diagnosing problems. 

- Straightforward UI and simple to use.  

- They constantly update their security features to keep things secure and safe for users. ","- The analytics, though extensive, is still lacking some granular information like being able to pull device type from meetings with 'not good' issues reported etc. 

- The CS can be very poor at responding, sometimes not at all, despite having a large number of licenses and being one of their long-term customers. 

- Their updates tend to prioritise non-essential features, such as virtual backgrounds and filters, as opposed to being able to see those in waiting rooms or integrate Slack into Zoom calls. ",,,,Pricing and scalability.

102,103,“Someone recommended Zoom”,Given the current climate everyone is trying to find solutions for running classrooms from home.  I was led to using Zoom by recommendation from other lecturers. In the scramble to find a universal solution that could work for everyone Zoom became the most popular solution. Having use the software for the past three months I can say that it does its job competently. Sadly I haven't upgraded to the pro version  but that might change given the unstable times we are in now.  Overall i like all the extra feature the software has. Its made having online tutorials a breeze.,"Well like many conference software it allows video chat and it comes with screen sharing which is essential when working with students. I also like the features that allows you to see who is muted as well as being able to mute them yourself. When doing screen sharing, I like the top bar that shows information about the current call and also the pop-up notification when someone is attempting to join the chat. Above all I enjoy the fact that I don't have to worry about what devices my students have as they can join using either PC or Cellphone. Especially cellphones as most of my student are more likely to have a cellphone or tablet than a laptop or desktop computer. ",My only issue is that there are other conferencing software that are free to use and because Zoom's free version is limited to 40 mins per session it can become annoying re-establishing meetings every time you run out of minutes. This leaves you with the only option of purchasing the pro version which can cost you either $15 per month or an annual fee of $150. At that cost you better be committed to using this software the whole year and not as a temporary solution to the current crisis. In the end you'll have to decide if the cost is worth the features it provides. ,Google Meet,It was more accessible for all my students.,Google Meet,
103,104,“Zoom Review”,The overall experience is really great for me because I have come to zoom from skype for business and its way better compared to that product. ,"Zoom is one of the best meeting app I have ever used. The interface is so simple and minimalist. Its fast to connect and its very much stable. The video and audio quality is really good compared to other products in its category. Here the chats stay for 7 days while in other similar products (e.g. skype) all the chats got deleted once we close the session. Sharing file over chats and in-built screenshot taking features make it awesome. Another cool feature is if you chat with people while you are sharing your screen, that chat window wont be shared through screen sharing. Its really a super cool features for privacy.","I don't have many complaint against zoom but there are few. In the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, when so many people started using zoom, I had lots of stability issues. But it got fixed through an update. A big shout-out for the zoom team. I feel like the chat staying time can be improved from 7 days to 30 days or more. Because a history is always better. Another problem I have faced is like whenever I am scheduling a meeting I can't invite people and share the meeting information from the zoom window. It redirects me to my outlook calendar and from there the rest can be done. Also my zoom doesn't sync other meeting from my calendar. It shows only those meeting which are created from zoom.",,It was a decision by my organization and I am thankful to them for this.,,
104,105,“Standard for large group meetings”,Zoom continues to be our go-to solution for Large group meetings (over 9 participants) and nearly all meetings with external participants.   We often will use MS Teams for smaller meetings but we allows our users to chose based on personal preference. ,I have used all of the video conferencing options on the Market and Zoom is the easiest to use while providing a consistent and stable experience for all.   ,"The only feature that I see lacking in Zoom is the same tight integration with the Microsoft Stack that Teams has.

Previously we were deploying Zoom as a conferencing tool for only international conferencing, or limited requirements, however now we are utilizing it for all of our meetings, video conferences and audio calls on a daily basis.","Zoom is one of the many software available for video conferencing, audio meetings as well as remote seminars. However one aspect where Zoom clearly is better than its counterparts is 'quality'. The connectivity for meetings initiated through Zoom is amazing, and so is the audio-video quality. I have tried several other applications including Teams and Meet, but Zoom provides a better experience.
It is easy to share the screen, and present slides etc. seamlessly whilst delivering to a wide audience. There is also an option to record- that is quite useful if team members are unavailable to attend.","Integration was fairly quick and simple. However I feel that the app could be improved, as it is not as robust as using the software on the computer. Also, I would like the option of just joining through the web and not have to download the app. I tried this the first time, but couldn't join the meeting as a result of this confusion.",GoToMeeting,"Cheaper option for short minutes (less than 40 minutes), recording option is better in Zoom.",,

We love the new Breakout Rooms, and Polls are great for maintaining interest.","We just pay for a simple ""Pro"" plan, but it allows our association to do what we need to do.  Our webinars never have over 100 present, so the low-level plan is fine for us.  All of our meetings are international, and we are really impressed with the global performance.  We recently used a technician in Azerbaijan to display slides for presenters in India, Australia, and Canada and the presentation was seamless.  We use ""Gallery Mode"" when meetings are small enough not to exceed bandwidth.  But for more than 8, we need to turn off videos and use Speaker View.  We are delighted that attendees can share their screen if they want to, and the delay is minimal.  Controlling the videos and microphones of attendees is easy.

We are also keen to avoid getting sucked in to a monolithic ecosystem like Apple, Google or Microsoft and the proprietary demands (be they hardware or software or your privacy) and Zoom ticks those boxes for us.
We are undeterred by the somewhat disingenuous negative press coverage of the product. It misses the point and is otherwise ill-informed. We aren't planning on changing our systems any time soon.","It just works. When our team travels to locations where connectivity isn't great, we've tried FaceTime, Hangouts, and a number of others (we already know that Skype barely works even with a good connection). Zoom is the only one that works consistently and reliably.
My heart always sinks when a client insists on using Skype or Microsoft Teams as I know that we'll always spend at least fifteen minutes of ""I can't hear you"" and logging out and back in again. I don't have a lot of time. I want to spend it wisely and I expect the technology I use to respect that.","The software is fantastic and clearly a lot of thought has gone in to it's design. However, we've found that their developer support is poor to non-existent which is a tremendous missed opportunity as we'd like to integrate the technology with other software we build.",,,,We had tried a number of systems over the years but they all had problems of one kind or another. Zoom just works. That's all we ask of any software we work with.
108,109,“Zoom has allowed us to continue holding our meetings”,"I've been utilizing Zoom to talk and meet with my collaborators while we're isolated gathering. With the current pandemic, Zoom has become a practically day by day program that I abuse for both work gatherings and virtual meetups with companions. I truly like how you'll have various clients on straightforwardly. I'm prepared to speak with various video calls. I abuse them for chapel meeting week by week and that they are incredible.","I am exceptionally happy with this product so far. I abuse it for a course that I'm taking, additionally on meeting with clients. The experience is magnificent. I'm hearing impeded and that I am marking to everyone on Zoom video meetings. With Zoom, we will video visit with them likewise as screen share, it's helped us continue pushing ahead through the franticness.","It can get mistaking for some clients legitimately with talking and commotion. Regularly need to have clients quiet for better solid quality. fixing a substitution meeting on the iPad took a touch you-tubing, yet after we made sense of it, it had been simple.",,,GoToMeeting,I found it a simpler alternative to use than several others we had in mind. Our team can use it without the need for a long learning process.
109,110,“Do You Zoom?”,"The software has been essential to our business. We use the video and audio connection, the screen sharing, the white board, and the chat functions.","Who does not Zoom these days? Since COVID-19 quarantining and social distancing has kicked in,  Zoom has been indispensable.  I like the ease of use, the screen share functions, the quality, and the recent upgrade.

UPGRADE: Being able to hold a zoom meeting or class for more that 40 minutes is essential for flow and  productivity.","I have been less than impressed with the customer service. I know they must be overloaded since COVID-19 entered the scene, but I am frustrated with the loose ends of the customer service department. The wait time for a service rep to get back to you is upwards of two to three days.  As a paying customer who has NO access to her zoom room, I believe I am being beyond patient with Zoom.  I presently use my business partner's Zoom room unless she is in there first. Then I use a ""free room"" and deal with the 40 minute time limit for 3 or more students in my classroom.",,,,"I was most familiar with Zoom. 
I own a tutoring center and I am a trainer for an International Health and Wellness Company. I have used the Zoom platform for years in my capacity as a trainer.  When I  needed to make the decision for an online classroom for my tutoring center, I naturally gravitated towards Zoom.  I had many parents and friends who offered advice (unsolicited). In spite of contrary advice, I went with Zoom. Now, if they would just call me back and resolve my account issue, I would be much happier!"
110,111,“Doesn't deserve the bad press”,"Our organization is able to work around the world, thanks to Zoom. We couldn't do our jobs without it. Videoconferencing isn't a perfect replacement for in-person communication, but it's a lot better than just email or text. And lots of people are using it for non-business purposes these days and experiencing the benefits of video calls to replace social engagements, or just to facilitate conversations with people who are far away. The negative press is really unfortunate, because it's not the platform's fault - but the fault of malicious people using it in unintended ways. If Zoom wasn't so successful, it wouldn't be getting attention from people with evil intentions. We'll still use Zoom long after this has blown over, and are thankful for how it enables us to work efficiently even with a distributed team.","Zoom has gotten a lot of negative press lately, but it's only a victim of its own success. The platform is deserving of its reputation as the go-to videoconferencing software for business, and even personal use these days. It does exactly what its supposed to: handle great video meetings, with a simple built-in chat feature to enable communication between those on the call. It's no-frills approach makes it easy to focus on what you're there for - the other people on the call and facilitating information exchange between them.","The chat feature could be better in ways, for example you can't transfer files or react to messages, and when you have a lot of people on a call using the chat heavily, it can get overwhelming. But it works for what it is. You're supposed to be talking to people on video, not typing to them. Some features could be expanded, like more offerings for virtual backgrounds, but these aren't essential features. Zoom gets it right where it counts - handling video and audio super well even on calls with hundreds of people on them.",,,,
111,112,“Modern Meetings Made Easy!”,"Overall, Zoom Meetings & Chat has become a great way to get work done in a simple manner. Everyone is online now, and in person conferences are outdated. Whether you're working from home, remotely, or need several members in different states to jump on a conference, and watch your screen for training purposes, I would recommend it.  Overall it is pretty easy to use, but I would definitely RUN A TEST MEETING FIRST with at least one other person so you can guide colleagues accessing it for the first time.

I have used other video meetings, and Zoom has worked seamlessly for me. Of course you don't need to use it just for business, my son's classroom uses it, as well as you can chat with family members, change backgrounds for fun interaction too. 

I will likely continue to use Zoom Meetings & Chat for a long while.","This is a great time to use modern software like Zoom Meetings & Chat for video conference and meetings. I will try to go over all the features which I believe makes this software customizable. 

You can use it either through a desktop, ipad or tablet, as well as your cell phone. The cellphone or other tablets may have limited features though. The thing I like the most about Zoom is being able to schedule several meeting, invite individual members to the meeting,  either through a meeting ID number and password (optional) or a specific URL as an easy access link. I believe all invited need to have the software downloaded AND create a login.   For training purposes, you can easily show your screen to your meeting members, so if they have a hard time accessing or understanding the information given to them, you can show them step by step. The host can also screen record the meeting to share with someone that wasn't available to attend the meeting. The host is the only one who can all members at once and individually mute/unmute. Everyone has the option of seeing a gallery of members on one screen or one person at a time (generally whoever is speaking). Lastly, there is a chat option included, but if you're on a tablet or phone you can't access the chat and see members at the same time. The chat is good to share links or information shared that you want members to access.  Sorry about the list but they really have SO MANY OPTIONS.","The host MUST have a strong internet capability otherwise there may be some lagging so keep that in mind. Also, members that are accessing the meeting over a phone or tablet may have a limited amount of features, so I highly recommend a desktop (with camera) and hard internet wired for a more professional approach. I do believe they have currently waived the 40 minute max for meetings, but generally, I think  you have to pay extra to have meetings longer than 40 minutes. This is not usually a problem, unless you have a very long meeting.

Meeting Security/Safety is another issue. I would HIGHLY suggest not sharing URL links online. ONLY SHARE URLS OR MEETING IDS DIRECTLY WITH WHO YOU WANT TO ATTEND, AND HAVE IT PASSWORD PROTECTED. If your meeting isn't password protected, it may be likely that anyone could access your meeting. The last thing you want is a stranger jumping into your meeting and roaming free on what they say or show. There are people like that out there, so save yourself the trouble. ",,,,
112,113,“Surprisingly Good For Distance Learning”,"Right now, my company is moving all language classes to Zoom for the foreseeable future until further notice, in order to commit to social distancing during the coronavirus crisis within the Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan regions. Although we are still within the first two weeks of transition, it has been a smooth one overall and both teachers and students (as well as company administrators) seem pleased enough in spite of the vast differences between virtual learning and in-person classes.","There are *so* many features that are amazingly effective for language learning in a virtual classroom. Besides the expected (and helpful) virtual whiteboard and screen sharing available to both me as the teacher and other users as students, there are also Breakout Rooms. This is essential for learning any foreign language; the Breakout Rooms simulate partnered or smaller group activities that are necessary for practicing the target language in context with another learner. These allow students to speak one-on-one (or in small groups) with each other for a brief exercise before returning to the Main Room of the video chat. The teacher can also check in on each of the private Breakout Rooms to make sure everything is running smoothly, and if a student requires immediate help, there is another button within a Breakout Room to let the teacher know. Lastly, one feature that I have not found in other video chat software such as Skype or Google Hangouts is the virtual hand-raising button. This prevents users from speaking over each other, and the host/teacher can immediately tell which student would like to ask a question. ","I think almost everything could potentially be improved... It is always harder to conduct a meeting virtually than in real life, especially when that meeting is a *language lesson.* It is the first stages, however, so I and my students will have to adapt over the next few weeks. That said, I am a little frustrated that the host/teacher cannot share a screen view or a whiteboard during the Breakout Rooms. This forces students to share their own screens with each other, and/or have other apps open at the same time. I would like for them to be able to access my lesson slides during their small group/partnered activities, but this doesn't seem to be possible yet with Zoom. ",,,,

The Slack integration is great. On a whim, we can go from chatting to Zoom by using ""/zoom"" in the Slack channel. This takes an issue from email, tickets, and chatting to a shared video conference where we can share screens and see what people are looking at and get resolutions faster.","This software is so easy to setup and use. Everything seems really well thought-out. The scheduled meetings give you easy calendar integrations for invitees. It provides a direct link to the meeting URL and all the phone numbers for dial-in. The preferences are easy to understand and provide way more than GoToMeeting, Cisco WebEx and BlueJeans. Meeting recordings locally or to the cloud are super helpful for group tutorials that you want to save or share. Multiple people can share their screen at the same time and you can request control of the remote shared screen. Very helpful with troubleshooting. You can change sound and video outputs straight from the software.

Zoom is the best video conference software I have ever used.","In sharing mode, the controls are stripped down and do not have text on the icons, so it can be difficult to know what they do. This goes away when you use the software every day and learn what the icons do, but this learning curve is steeper than it needs to be. The chat design it decent and doesn't cover the shared screen, like bluejeans does. However, it is just a simple chat and there could be more integrations here. We just resort to using Slack during the meeting to share links, etc. The chat is a bit hidden and not well integrated into the design.",Google Meet,National Geographic Partners was created as a joint venture with 21st Century Fox in 2015 and Fox had a Zoom contract in place so we moved to Zoom and dropped Google Hangouts.,,
115,116,"“Great for collaborative meetings where participants are in different locations, easy to use”","For a period of time, I solely worked from home because I had young children. Zoom was a game changer for me! I was able to be present for staff meetings, have regular meetings with my boss(es) to discuss tasks & meet with other staff when needed to coordinate projects or train others. It was instrumental in allowing me to work from home and still stay connected to the team and on the right path with my tasks! ","This is an amazing tool that allows you to collaborate and connect with others easily, and you have the convenience of being able to do so from all different locations. In terms of features, one of my personal favorites is to be able to share a screen with the other participants. It's been a great support to be able to use a visual in meetings in addition to the verbal discussion. I also love that I can hit the downsize button on the Zoom screen and it will become a small icon on the screen that still streams the video and allows me to see who is talking, but it frees up my screen to multitask. Zoom is also flexible - meetings can be scheduled in advance or on the fly and shared with others. It's easy to share the meeting with others, and the program itself is easy to use! There is minimal set-up required to get Zoom functioning on your computer and that only needs to be done once.

most impactful features, easy to use? integration w business easy?

","Missing features or improvement needed? Difficult to use? 

As mentioned in the Pros, one of my favorite functions is to be able to share my screen with other participants. However, it's not a true screen share - you're only sharing one item (an open file, document, or website, etc). If you move to a different item on your computer it does update the screen for the other participants. Only the file/website/doc that you originally picked will show to the other users. At times that set up is perfect and allows you to look at other things on your computer without disrupting the meeting. However, I wish there were an option to have the screen share update based on what the sharer is looking at. At times I have a number of things I need to show the other participants, and it becomes tedious to have to close the screen share and re-open it whenever I want to change what I'm showing the participants.",,,,
116,117,“It Works”,"Not great. It connects and works, as long as you're not using AirPods. ","It generally connects and stays connected despite the network quality.

","You can not use Apple AirPods with this software. It's a known issue and Zoom has done nothing to fix it. What happens is you will connect your AirPods to the machine you're using via Bluetooth and then when -- which has to happen in that order if you want any slim possibility of it working -- then you connect to Zoom. Once you're in Zoom it ""Detects a change to your audio settings"" and makes you punch in your computer password to ""authorize"" the change to your AirPods.

We do not have to email our spreadsheets or presentations before the meeting, constantly reminding everyone where to look or what we are discussing to stay on topic.

It is effortless to meet online with some of the customers to identify their needs and guide them to some service that the company can offer. The experience is quite intuitive even for new users, so I haven't had any problems with it.
Sending files through Zoom saves the time of sending an email, so all participants can focus on the meeting using a single application.
The overall performance is outstanding, it simulates a face-to-face meeting quite well. Sharing the window that I choose and keeping the floating window that shows my interlocutor makes communication very easy. It seems that everything works very well.","The meetings with Zoom are high, and it consumes almost no bandwidth, the audio and video work correctly even with a slow Internet connection. The experience is very satisfying because of the excellent performance, no matter if it's the desktop application or the smartphone application.
It is simple to start the meeting; you need to share just a link. Even registration for new users is speedy, so starting to use the application only takes a few minutes. It is very efficient.
I love the functionality of sharing only the window I choose. That allows me to have total control and privacy during the meeting. It makes dealing with clients very comfortable. It's also great for times when we have to take notes.
Sending documents in the chat is very fast, which improves the experience.","Chat sometimes takes a while to send or receive text messages. It is not entirely real-time. The time difference is not much, but it makes it unfeasible to have a fast conversation in that way.
The price is somewhat high, so it is an expense to consider for professional use. Still, I think it's worth every penny. And for those who are not convinced, meetings can be held up to 40 minutes.

121,122,“Zoom: Easy to Learn and Should Replace Any Other Video Conferencing Software You Have”,"Overall my experience with Zoom has been overwhelmingly positive. Once you get over the initial bumps in the road to figure out how to best use it, it shines as a software. I have never had a dropped, stalled, or buffered call, I have never had audio issues, it really is a cut above the rest in that regard. After using Zoom I can't imagine going back to competitors like Skype or Google Hangouts for video conferencing.","It's honestly very easy to use. Even our clients who don't necessarily have Zoom downloaded prior to a Zoom Meeting find it easy to get up and running which really takes the burden off of us and relieves any back and forth having to explain how to work the program during time that should be spent already on a call. The functionality of the software does not change very much between the free version and the more premium versions which I appreciated; the paid version really only seems to remove the restrictions of the free version so it didn't feel like having to learn a brand new program once we made the switch. Everything is labeled fairly clearly, and I didn't have to research the software extensively to find out how to work each function because of how user-friendly it is. The options to use your computer audio or call in by phone really makes it shine I think though, as most video conferencing software does not provide the either/or option, which I think anyone who has been in a video conference will know only leads to lackluster audio quality. ","I think if Zoom created a handbook or user guide that they sent to each person or business who purchases their software, it would really put them above the rest. The software is user-friendly, but I did have to google a few things to figure out how to work certain elements of the software. I understand the reasoning behind defaulting every call to password protected, but I think it should be optional, as there are already a lot of numbers involved in accessing a call and throwing in a password has confused more than one of my meeting participants. The invitation to each zoom meeting I think is also a little unclear, when you first start using the program it is an overwhelming amount of information to have put in front of you and with the addition of multiple phone numbers by time zone and two different links it can be difficult to puzzle out. If it was a little more clearly defined I think it would be perfect, I know I had to trial and error myself before figuring out how to do it right every time.

122,123,“Zoom Review ”,I am very happy with our choice to move to Zoom. It is not very resource intensive and is more cost effective than Webex. No additional 'Firewall work' was needed to get it going on our network and the interface is clean. The web admin console is easy to use and makes managing licenses a breeze. We are able to save on the amount of licenses needed as non licensed user still has 45 minutes of meeting time. Users are normally prompted very clearly about how soon the 45min time will elapse and it helps to wrap up meetings. I highly recommend Zoom for any size organization. ,"I like the fact that Zoom is not very resource intensive and runs very well within our virtual environment. Video rendering is surprisingly good on a virtual machine with 1 core and 2Gb of memory. We opted to install the client on the base image which did not affect performance negatively in any way. The web version is compatible with IE11, Chrome and Firefox and users do not feel restricted by choosing to use the browser vs the client. ","Migrating from Webex, our users did not seem to ""figure it out"" right away. There were a little hand-holding initially especially with the ""sharing screen"" portion. What we would find is that users would click ""share screen"" and nothing happens as there is another step to the process where the decision needs to be confirmed. Confirming this decision is essentially, I am in no way advocating for it's removal, but maybe adding a dialogue box as a prompt, that makes the rest of Zoom inactive, so the user sees that confirmation is needed before doing anything else. ",Webex,Zoom is more cost effect and less resource intensive.

I think it's a brilliant piece of software.","I think it's intuitive to use. I really like how easily you can hand control to another participant. I like that you can annotate the screen and collapse the camera views to be able to view the screen more easily. I like that you can easily show your entire monitor, or just one window. It's secure and easy to use and it has transformed the way we hold conference calls.","We actually ended up producing a small eLearning module on how to use zoom, to send to our clients. Although I find it intuitive, we did find that sometimes clients wouldn't know they had to connect their audio and microphone, and they'd just think it wasn't working. When we went to find a simple web page explaining how to use zoom, we found there wasn't one - so we made one.",Join.Me,"Join.me wasn't reliable or customisable enough.

The Linux version definitely needs polishing in the user experience to get up to speed to the Windows version, as some meeting controls get in the way when working with customers. For this software and another unrelated one, I had to switch back to Windows, because definitely it was getting in the way on my productivity. Guilty of bad UX in Linux.

None of them offer everything you want without some glitches or issues. That said, I've used countless other products/vendors and can I attest that Zoom is easily the best of its class available on the market. I love that there is a simple Zoom add-on you can download into your personal Outlook to make scheduling meetings incredibly easy. Love that all employees get their own accounts/unique login ID's. I think the mobile app is also a big plus, as I have joined meetings and viewed what others are sharing directly on my phone. The customization options are outstanding. ","Couple of areas for improvement:
- It doesn't need to blast super loud ""this call is being recorded."" That can freak some interviewees out. Consider changing to a visual cue that the call is being recorded (or a more subtle audio cue)
- Really wish there was a feature that warned you when you've accidentally scheduled two zoom meetings that overlap (with the same user/login). Could be helpful 
- The biggest issue in my opinion is the fact that sometimes I don't fully end a zoom meeting and when I have another zoom call/meeting immediately in succession, it can sometimes say that the other meeting hasn't ended and I somehow am not able to end the first meeting in order for others to join the new meeting. 
-Overlapping meetings (under a single user login) is by far the biggest area for improvement. We run into that issue pretty regularly
- Sometimes the call/meeting recordings don't show up or download",,More user accounts for the same price,,

Since Zoom encrypts connections end to end, it works out great. It also was really easy to use their API, and it was very well documented. We rarely had issues with reliability through Zoom being used directly within our software. I thought it was very easy to use, and a much better option than most other video platforms. We also made great use of the reporting mechanism to know how much utilization we were getting out of Zoom. And the meetings that we generated across the organization, since we purchased an API subscription, were easy to customize for the settings on each meeting.

","What I like most about Zoom software is that the software is available to use a no charge. The software has several features that I find to be extremely efficient

Zoom allows you to have a one on one conference with any user in the world. You can use the software to do a conference call with technology devices such as computers, tablets and cell phone devices.

The software utilizes audio, video and screen sharing capabilities. You can share your device screen so your audience can view a presentation, hear your voice and see you live via video camera. 

The Zoom software also allows you to screen record your device or computer. This function is key because you can record your presentations or conferences and use the recorded video later as a media marketing tool.

The software is very easy to learn and is beginner friendly. Zoom also has very friendly customer support and technical assistance. I would recommend the software to any user who is interested in audio video conferencing software.

Very user friendly and works really fast!","Having many off-shore clients, we use this tool for everything, from simple support calls to full demos. Zoom really shines when you compare it to other tools available in the market; we experience little to no latency in our calls, video or shared screen streaming, which is incredibly valuable when working remotely and convincing clients that this is not a limitation. In my personal experience, I never had a call dropped or a freezed screen. Audio quality is really good, even when having multiple callers from different locations. While acting as organizer I can easily manage speaking permissions and turns, making good use of the ""raise hand"" option.
Last but not least, the application is very easy to install and use, even if you're downloading it for the first time, just click on the link to the meeting and you're set. ","When sharing control of the screen, Zoom does not allow control over applications opened in Administrator Mode, which is almost always when working in dev or UAT environments.

Quality is good (better than any other, but still could use improvement) and it has tons of features that I like. Really enjoy Zoom Rooms for conference rooms. I like that they are hardware agnostic. I got a Polycom Trio 8800 which acts as both the audio and the controller. Paired that with a cheapo PC from Amazon, an existing projector, and an inexpensive web cam to create a really nice solution. We add meetings to a conference room calendar and when you show up you can start the meeting with a single button from the Polycom. Very slick, although it took me a bit to get it configured properly.",It's frustrating that I have to buy both a Zoom Room license AND a pro user just to setup that room. The pro user should be included with the room since it is necessary to make it work.

Even external clients with no experience using ZOOM can access it and use it with little issue. As with all products, the more people are comfortable with the tools that ZOOM provides, the greater collaboration can be. Once people understand this, they find ZOOM to be one of the best tools for their day-to-day and begin scheduling their own web conferences. I think that alone demonstrates how useful ZOOM can be.","ZOOM is incredibly easy to use. The product is intuitive for the average user and can get you started with a web conference in little time. Most industries rely on some sort of off-site conferencing tool, particularly for large organizations with multiple locations. ZOOM has a quick turnaround, you can have you conference set-up and details to attendees right away. The ZOOM UI during a meeting is very helpful as well, you can switch between a presentation, to video conferencing, and teleconferencing with single commands. Other users are presented with a simple and intuitive dashboard to allow them to share and participate. I have never run into a technical issue that wasn't easily overcome, and almost never had any issues during a presentation. Participants have a wide array of participating as well, with a helpful and discrete chat box and ways to ""jump-in"" without needing to pause the conference.","Audio can be tricky depending on how you have your conference rooms set-up. When using at home or at a desk, this is not an issue, but in conference rooms with in-room audio connected to the presenting computer, there can be echo. This is mostly user-caused and can be easily fixed, but it is something that has come up more than once. Some users have trouble figuring out how to mute or turn their camera off, and the web conference client at times requires refreshing when it doesn't launch initially.

143,144,“A great alternative to GoToMeeting and WebEx”,Zoom is a worthy competitor to GoToMeeting and Webex even if it still lacks some useful features. It does excel in large group environments and video screen participation. ,"Zoom is a full featured virtual meeting/collaboration software. As a long-time user of GoToMeeting, I found Zoom to be an excellent alternative.  One of the great things about Zoom is the extent that it can be customized to each individual user. Zoom leverages most of its strengths if it's applied within a large organization. Each user gets to customized how they engage Zoom at startup. For instance when entering a meeting, users can set as their defaults such things as entering a meeting with microphone and camera turned off.. No embarrassing ""gotcha"" moments.  Zoom allows multiple options for screen sharing, using single or multiple screens, or highlighting one app. Zoom also allows for whiteboards.

Customer support is generally prompt and helpful.  Two billing disputes were resolved within a few minutes.  Technical support is also generally helpful and responsive.  A problem with echoes and distortion was quickly diagnosed in the middle of a meeting and fixed with minimal interruption. 

","One of the glaring defects of Zoom is not being able to share controls.. While users may designate another meeting attendee as a host, it doesn't allow for passing off of controls. Which is not the same thing. Several users of competitor titles like GoToMeeting or WebEx, find this feature very useful as it lets other meeting attendees manipulate their screen while still retaining overall control of the meeting.  

The control elements are a bit more spread out on the desktop app than users may be used to with GoToMeeting and WebEx.   in some cases this means more screen real estate is available for actual meeting content, but it can also make things a little bit harder to find.

It's quickly become one of our team's most valuable collaboration tools. It feels like a shared meeting platform that's truly collaborative. Instead of one person starting and running a meeting, we can each step in and lead on-the-fly, naturally. So far, this platform feels more like your team being in the same room together than other professional meeting platforms.","It's easy to start and join meetings -- both for internal teams and external clients. Just send a link and anyone can participate. This is a very intuitive alternative to platforms like Skype, Join.me and GoToMeeting. And our team's experience is that it's more reliable than Skype. We're a small group of remote workers, so our team is online together via Zoom daily, some of us continuously for multiple hours. It's easy to swap screen share (no need to ""promote"" a participant to ""presenter""; easy to record and keep meetings. We use the chat feature to share files and off-screen commentary. We love being able to see each other in real time, which makes our meeting and collaboration time feel almost ""in-person."" Best of all, each of us on our team has our own unique meeting link. We've bookmarked each other's ""Zoom Rooms,"" so we can easily hop on and off with each other as needed for ""huddles"" throughout the day. Our clients appreciate the ""face-to-face"" meeting time. It's just as easy for them to participate. Zoom feels really organic and collaborative. The platform never gets in the way.","If you are presenting on Zoom you have to keep your eye on the screen to see if you have chat messages waiting, but that is the same with GoToMeeting. The chat alert is definitely more visible than in GoToMeeting, and it feels more natural and less distracting to open and respond to the chat in Zoom.

","Because you can combine phone and video options, there's virtually no reason people can't join your meeting virtually! 

At two companies where we've used this software, we've been able to have remote meetings, schedule calls for clients, and woo investors. And this was before we were on the subscribed plan! 

Zoom's free version (requires download on your phone) is awesome for doing a video chat with clients or even as a prelim interview for new employee candidates. Because the software is free, or access on a computer is a breeze, you can video chat with people that may not have iphone, skype or whatever else that generally requires an account. ","In reality, the problems were probably more likely user error than Zoom's fault, I would love to see a way for Zoom to notify the participants that one of the feeds is frozen or glitching. I know this likely has a lot more to do with the streaming connection of the person on the line. However, if Zoom were able to indicate that one person's feed was frozen through detecting no new data, the other participants might have a better chance to pause the conversation if necessary.  Without the notification, people will continue talking and eventually have to backtrack using more time than necessary.

The second ""Con"" is that well, if you need to connect with an older generation, you might want to coach them through this in advance.

149,150,"“A Fine, Very Customizable Video Conferencing Tool with Extra Features”","My experience with this software has been reliable when excluding certain behaviors, such as moving Zoom windows around when recording or using the annotation tool. I haven't got the chance to use frequently this software on other devices, but I have mixed feelings when using it on a Linux system because of the aforementioned issues. I find Zoom is a solid option for one-on-one meetings, particularly considering everything needed works perfectly on a free plan. For bigger meetings, a Premium plan is a must and one can still benefit a lot from this software. It has enabled me to do screen sharing very easily without having to know anything about video recording or editing. Even on low-end PCs, I feel that Zoom is quite capable of rendering a good enough video for formal meetings that need to be shared later by other means. The encoding used for exported videos is a great compromise between size and quality, making it a viable option when it comes to sharing a meeting online. I wouldn't recommend Zoom for producing high-quality videos intended for commercial use or for presentations with a large audience (above 100 participants), but it works perfectly fine for personal projects and for most business meetings. I find I could benefit more if I were able to use all the available features as one often needs to rely on workarounds such as using an image editing tool to make drawings from screenshots instead of being able to directly work on the screen as intended by the software.","Zoom brings to the table premium features for free. One-on-one meetings are not time-limited or missing any essential option. It is possible to set up recurring meetings by generating a permanent Zoom link, which is very useful to have custom links for many different contacts. Zoom makes it possible to share the screen with others: either to record a solo session; screen share with others in a meeting while having the ability to record audio and video; share only a specific window or the entire desktop and there's also a quick way to switch between different screens from participants, all of it being configurable in the application. Scheduling a new meeting is straightforward and numerous options are presented to make it easy to obtain the desired behavior by default when launching a meeting. Meetings can also be integrated with external calendars and provide more advanced options to facilitate interactions when the meeting starts, such as automatically recording on the local computer and asking for a password to prevent unauthorized access. Being able to chat with attendees and store all relevant information about them in an address book inside Zoom are other features that make interactions with frequent users a breeze. There are plenty of settings available from the main window to adjust audio, video and recording details and even integration with dual monitors.","Technical issues are present with the Linux desktop application in certain hardware conditions, especially with the annotation tool, rendering it totally useless. While using that tool, the screen isn't updated in real-time and won't allow displaying drawings with a transparent background to make it possible to annotate on the screen while keeping the desktop visible in the background. There are also various notable glitches when moving Zoom windows around, such as the video window being duplicated when recording and staying on the screen for extended periods of time, ruining the quality of any recording being made. Because of those shortcomings, it is impractical to try and move the windows when recording and some features simply need to be forgotten at those times. It is also inconvenient that the toolbar won't display properly when set at the bottom of the screen, as it only opens from top to bottom, making the list of tools go outside the bottom part of the screen and effectively unreachable. There is no way to resize the toolbar which occupies too much space on tiny monitors (screen size of 13 inches and below). In a similar fashion, the main window when a meeting is happening can't easily be resized as some buttons will disappear and become unusable, making it harder to record the session or end the meeting.",,,,
150,151,"“Zoom, Zoom, Zoom - For a smooth ride to your next online event”",,"Affordable. Reliable. Easy. That's Zoom in a nutshell. We have experienced the heartache of running a webinar only to have the audio cut in and out and glitch the entire time - ultimately causing our attendees to drop off. But, that's not the case with Zoom. Our company, belonging to the industry of software QA and testing, regularly hosts remote meetings to check in and collaborate on progress and future team initiatives. We decided to make the switch from GoToMeeting (a great alternative to Zoom) because it fit our needs more accurately. Zooms customer support is remarkably responsive and very quick to solve any issues encountered.

Pros
Zoom video conference calling and webinar is fitting for any sized company or organization. Meetings can be scheduled within seconds and added directly from Zoom's platform to Google Calendar, Yahoo Calendar, or Outlook Calendar; which allows you to set up invites and add additional attendees.

Zoom provides the option to either enroll in a monthly or an annual plan, in which you can choose to deactivate and/or reactivate at any time (beneficial for saving extra bucks if you do not run regular monthly webinars). The plan that includes 100 participants, for both video conferencing and webinar, are priced at an affordable price per month (GoToWebinar is nearly double in price for the same plan). 

The audio on calls and webinars comes across crisp; we have never experienced any issues with dropped calls or glitches during webinars). 

Having the ability to join calls and webinars from any desktop, tablet, and/or phone (iOS and android) is convenient for anyone looking to access meetings on the go. Zoom includes various features, i.e. live screen-sharing, whiteboard, etc., which helps relieve the difficulties of working remotely.  

If you are holding an international meeting, I.e. training, trainees can join by laptop and listen over laptop speakers (they would have to use laptop and not call in directly via phone to avoid having to pay for extra international call credits - which costs an additional /month). 
Zoom comes in handy when working with distributed teams; Zoom's conference calling features are great for doing demos, exercises, sprint planning, etc.","When joining a webinar or a call via mobile device, it's unclear how to join audio (I thought there was something wrong with my phone because it was telling me my audio was on but I could not hear anything during the webinar - turns out I couldn't see the audio number which was hidden behind the webinar). If anyone else has this confusion you can also look at the original webinar confirmation or follow-up reminder and locate the call-in number there. 

The poll questions and results to not display in the webinar recordings so you will have to edit or takes screenshots and merge them into your recording (we use I movie to do this).",,,,

With Zoom I can easily schedule my client meetings. I actually have the invitation already pasted into my appointment confirmation and reminder autoresponder, with the url and dial-in information. It's so easy to manage appointments this way. 

The recording feature is helpful as well. When your session is over, the recording is available in different formats, video and audio, and gets automatically processes and stored in your computer and available to upload to my clients.

I like the video conferencing feature for groups as well, with different screen possibilities. I can choose to view everyone at once, only a few people at once, or the speaker. This is helpful for webinars and group coaching. 

Share screen is a feature I use in different ways. For client enrollment conversations. I can actually share the Agreement form and go through all of the contract terms in real time, being able to close the sale more quickly. In client sessions I can go through their website or materials and give real-time feedback, which is invaluable. 

Chat feature makes workshops, webinars and group sessions engaging and lively. The speaker can read the chat questions and comments and respond. ","I can't find much to compain about. I was using the free feature and was dissapointed that I couldn't have a longer session with more than one person, but I've since upgraded. There is a video tutorial for how to do a background in the upgraded version but I'm  finding it a little hard to follow. At one point I thought I had a different version of Zoom than the one they were showing. So that was confusing.  ",,,,
152,153,“great conferencing features for effective moderation and audience management”,"In totality, Zoom has transformed the way we run our department. There is now less physical movement of staff between wards and different units to consult with each other and share observations or results. Zoom's file transfer, collaborative and live communication tools, have allowed for speedier internal processes in managing cases and at the same time, allow staff to focus their energies more efficiently.","The screen sharing feature allows more than one participant to share their screens simultaneously with each other. With this feature, we are able to quickly share scan results of patients with staff in other units as it happens, without needing to transfer files to other devices or shared locations. Other features I have come to love are the live chat, and the auto-generated call transcripts that save us a lot of time and makes our meetings run much faster.","Issues on data security keep lurking in the background at every turn.

Easy to use and integrates with a lot of softwares and processes. The user interface is really clean and minimal.,"A host cannot schedule two calls which overlap - often I need to do this as I need to be on the start of a call but need to leave other team members to continue it whilst I go on to another call. This isn't an option even on Pro. There's also issues with recurring meeting functionality - it's not very customisable and it also shows the attendees the original date when loading the meeting, even several weeks after the originally scheduled. This causes a lot of attendees to drop off assuming they have the wrong link. The ability to send invites via email and have a better calendar would be great.",Microsoft Teams,,Microsoft Teams,
154,155,“Solid virtual meeting software”,"Overall, Zoom has been great. It not only has solved problems, but opened up completely new opportunities for growth. We used to rely mostly on in person meetings (local), but now we are able to meet with any client from all over the country at any time. The same goes for training. We are able to provide training with the best field leaders in the company to anyone who's able to login. ","I like how easy it is to use for brand new people, or maybe folks who aren't as tech savvy. People used to technology shouldn't have any issues with most of the software experience. The call quality is usually excellent and mostly only limited by the quality of each user's audio/video equipment. Screen sharing and similar features are great and almost a necessity for business, and Zoom does this well.","Unfortunately, sharing control of the screen is NOT an option if you own a Chromebook, even if it's a powerful one like mine, it doesn't matter. Zoom does not support sharing screen CONTROL with others, which in our business is ESSENTIAL to get business done. So if you're business relies heavily on Chromebooks and sharing screen control is a requirement, you're going to have to make an adjustment somewhere.",,,Google Meet,"Zoom was more popular, and well known, so it was more sensible to use something that accomplished all of our needs.

I also use zoom to meet with students or parents one on one, or to meet with other colleagues as well. The features and zoom have made it a terrific platform to use in education this year. I appreciate the safety features offered, such as the ability to send people out of the room, lock meetings, and use a password for entrance. This goes along way in safe guarding things for my students.","As someone who is now using teleconferencing daily, I appreciate that even the free version of zoom offers appearance touchups and adjustments for low lighting. This is a great feature! I also enjoy being able to change my background. I do find that zoom lags less than other video conferencing software I've used. I also like the waiting room feature, and the ability to mute and turn off the cameras of other participants in the meeting. As a teacher, this has been very helpful. I also like that I can send students to the waiting room if needed. Additionally, I like that there are settings for a chat and sharing. Breakout rooms are also an awesome feature. There are a lot of great things about zoom!","It's difficult to complain about a version that is free! However, it is a little bit strange that there is a 40 minute limit to the free version. When you schedule a meeting, zoom does not give you a meeting time frame of 40 minutes. You can choose an hour, or half an hour, but it does not offer 40 minutes. If that is the limit, it would be helpful for that to be an option for scheduling. ",,"Not all of my students had G Suite account.

We use it daily and for different reasons.  ,"We have been using Zoom for several years, but never to the extent that we have been using it since March.  Zoom has allowed us to stay connected as a team and also connect with our clients.  I find the ease of use to be the most appealing.  I have 6 year olds and 60 year olds that are both able to access our meetings efficently and easily.  I love that it integrates with my calendar, and I can invite others to various meetings.  I was very happy with the customer service we received as we were deciding to upgrade our account, and I love that I can use it on my phone but also as an app on my computer.

While there were some minor challenges to using the platform, it functioned well most of the time and was a critical software for my business during an otherwise detrimental time period. ","The screen-sharing feature of Zoom was one of the primary reasons I chose to use this platform ahead of other softwares I considered purchasing. Zoom was a must-have purchase for the transitioning of my tutoring business to an online format. The ability to host video calls with ease and share my screen with my students literally saved my business and eased a lot of my stress during a pivotal time. I liked the waiting room feature, which enabled my students to log on to the meeting before I had officially started it. I liked that all users had the options of enabling and disabling their microphones and cameras. Call quality was usually excellent. ","There were frequent updates to some settings without my knowledge, which resulted in some trial-and-error to figure out which settings I needed to change or reset. Some examples include suddenly requiring passwords to meetings which had formerly not required passwords, and a change which muted attendees' mics automatically upon entry into the meeting. These settings were changed not by me but by the Zoom platform, and since I was unaware of these changes at first, I had to guide my young students on the Zoom call through some basic troubleshooting to resolve those problems. ",,"I made the switch due to Zoom's ability to screen share, which is not a feature available on WeChat video calls. Screen sharing is very crucial for educators using this tool for teaching. ",,
161,162,“Easy-to-use Virtual Meeting Platform”,"Zoom has been an incredible resource for our organization. Both our staff and volunteers are located across the nation and around the globe. Zoom allows us to stay connected, effectively run meetings, engage participants in large meetings through Breakout Rooms, and even provide lines to our volunteers to use for their local groups and purposes. We also have several volunteers over 50 years of age in our organization. Many of them have learned to engage and use Zoom to stay connected and be more involved. While there are questions, this software is easy to learn for both our younger Staff and older volunteers. ","My favorite feature of Zoom is the capability to go into Breakout Rooms. When meeting in a larger group, or even if you just need to split up into pairs, you can easily manually or automatically assign participants to smaller groups called Breakout Rooms. This adds so much to a meeting and allows meetings with more participants to still participate and engage.","As a meeting host, when I share my screen, it's difficult to access and interact with the chat box.

163,164,“A Graduate Student's Experience on Zoom Meetings”,"My overall experience with Zoom meeting software is very good. It also makes distance irrelevant in conducting meetings, conferences, and classes since all of these events could now be done online through the Zoom meeting software. It also increases the number of participants since there are no more traffic or transportation problems to deal with.","What I like most about the software is its easy-to-navigate features and affordability. It offers a personal account that is free (with a maximum of 30 minutes of meeting time) and paid options that are licensed to the paying entities (in my case, to the university where I am currently enrolled). The software's improved security feature for license accounts ensures that only authorized users have access to a specific meeting ID, which prevents unauthorized users or intruders. In addition, the software's recording feature also makes it easy for the students to review what had been discussed during the classes he/she attended as the professors can record the class sessions and upload it in the class folder for easy access to the students. The host(s) of the meeting/session can also minimize untoward distractions during the meeting/lecture proper by disabling cameras and microphones and turning them on again during the open forum or group discussions. And more importantly, the zoom software is used by students like me for recording individual and group video presentations. ","The use of the software depends on the internet connection of the users. When an internet connection is poor, a person should expect a lagging connection and one might even be disconnected during the meeting/class proper. Another limitation is the technical specifications of the computer device, tablet, or smartphone that is used to connect to the software. A device's low technical capability may limit the bandwidth used, hence may affect camera usage. It will not also be able to use some of the software's features such as virtual background or video effects.",,,,

During COVID-19 lockdowns we met frequently and never had a hiccup. It was also nice to be able to change my background so that my home was not revealed. The meetings are simple, flexible, and useful in many situations. They frequently make updates to improve security, which are a bit of a double-edged sword. Sometimes a habitual workflow is broken by an update, and we have to develop a new best-practice to accommodate the new security measures. To be clear, this is a positive thing...just a little jarring. We got used to it though.","Zoom is simple to get going, but has a lot of useful options beyond the basics. I like that I could easily make a vanity MeetingID to allow others to join my room on the fly, but scheduled meetings are also great to have. The ability to password protect a scheduled meeting with a  unique code is great for security, though I haven't developed the need for it yet...partly due to the ability to have a waiting room *and* allow the entire account in without needing to knock. This allows great flexibility for the security of my room. Also the audio quality in Zoom far outshines many alternatives, making meetings more pleasant/bearable. There's more to like, but I've already rambled in this section!","I came to Zoom after several years of experience with another, more-established meeting-oriented product. The one thing I wish I could do (or figure out) with Zoom is create individualized room layouts that everyone sees, and pre-load certain content (like a slide deck) directly into the room without having to share my screen.

That being said, Zoom does a great job of being good at the ones that really matter to me. With zoom, I do not travel as much because a face to face conference seems to suffice most situations and the meetings can be flexible to work with different time zones. Having a link to my meetings directly in the calendar invite has been a huge benefit for me as clients know exactly where to go to access the conference. This has been a good tool and I would recommend it to my peers. ","I think we can all agree that one of the worst things about conferencing with a new client or employee is walking them through the setup and install if the tool. Then going through and making sure their microphone is connected and so forth. This is what makes Zoom so great. The one click install to start using the tool really makes things simple, streamlined, and best of all, it makes you look like an expert because it is set up in seconds.   Being able to see everyone's face in the meeting is a game changer as well because your meetings are more personable and you can really gauge people's responses to items as you bring them up. They take the ease of use even further by being able to chat, mute and raise your hand, this is especially true if there are multiple people on a call. It is simply a great tool. ","Some of the biggest cons I see are:

Not being able to configure backgrounds. Not doing can add distractions

Occasionally, there are times where one of my attendees or I will join the call only to be the lone person in the conference.  Then we have to leave and rejoin to get into the correct conference. 

Computer audio can be a pain as it pick up a lot of background noise and there is usually an echo

174,175,“Zoom for Campus Meeting and Remote Faculty ”,"Overall this has helped us to reach online students so they feel that we are real, live people and not just some robot behind an email address. Being able to video chat on a platform that doesn't really have technical difficulties in using has been a huge help for those that are less comfortable with sites that we typically use to video chat or host webinars or advising groups. I think that the ease of use in learning how to  operate a zoom meeting is a big pro. Additionally, this has completely changed how we can work with candidates who aren't able to attend on campus interviews in our actual physical space. This is opening up a lot of possibilities for us!","This product is essential to our team. We use this for a variety of reasons which to name a few include: communicating with students for advising or progressions meetings, communicating with fellow staff members or team members who are working remotely or telecommuting, communicating with faculty who are out of state, hosting large school or department/college meetings to allow multiple staff or faculty to ""remote in"" at the same time so even though they are not physically in the space, they can still see and hear what is going on in the physical meeting and we can hear them and see them as well. 
I think this is a great concept for smaller meetings where we are all remote as well. It's kind of hard sometimes to schedule up conference calls and being able to use personal laptops or work computers to video chat with a smaller group has allowed us to stay more connected. As an added bonus, it really puts a face to faculty that we really see or who are out of state so we don't ever see them physically on our campus. It helps to create a sense of team and unity when we are all so far apart sometimes.
The pricing options are AWESOME as well! The service teams have been great about working with us to switch things up or bump our plans up as well. The video quality for what we get, even with internet/bandwith problems has always been top notch too, which I really love.

Overall, Zoom Meeting is one of my favorites meeting platform because the features provided in it specific and helpful for students like me.","Since I am a student, paying a platform to meet is not necessary as there are many other free platform that I can use. As I use free trial Zoom Meeting, I can use the platform to meet for only 40 minutes. As soon the duration end, I have to make another meeting to continue it. This makes me frustrating as I have to make so many meeting in one time.",Microsoft Teams,It is free and more features that I needed.,,

I have also used other softwares for meeting but found more advantages in it.,"Zoom meetings is just amazing. In this lockdown situation when people are not allowed to take onsite classes, it serves as the best tool for online classes. It can be use it on  mobile phone as well as on laptop without any issue. Zoom is best for large video conference which allows alot of members to connect with each other. Any one can share the screen to present the slides with participants. It also facilitates its user by giving recording option. A teacher can record his/her lecture to share with students. Their is a chat option in zoom through which students can ask any query from teacher.","Zoom offers 40 minutes session in free version and automatically terminate the meeting after it.

No lengthy or complex downloading of software.  The downloading is quick and easy upon joining a Zoom meeting for the first time.  I love that I can easily record, mute participants, run polls, form breakout rooms.  The chat feature during meetings is helpful.

180,181,“Easy and ubiquitous”,"We recently switched from Webex to Zoom for a few key reasons:
1) The technology was better and we had fewer technical concerns. There are still issues sometimes where two users join the same meeting but do not find each other but those incidents are rare. The overall conferencing quality is good and we have few issues related to the use of this software.
2) Virtual backgrounds are supported, allowing our professionals to appear in the office even if they are remote.
3) Breakouts are easier to manage in Zoom rather than Webex. ","Zoom is the market-leading video conferencing software. It is easy to create meetings using the Outlook plug-in, easy to join meetings created by others, and easy to facilitate meetings using this tool. Overall, the ease of use is the most compelling feature -- everyone knows how to join a Zoom these days!

Our entire company relied on this one software for essential communication while working remotely for a long period of time. ,"The ease with which you can join and conduct meetings is the best thing about Zoom. When the Pandemic hit, this software was a life saviour and played a major role in helping people work remotely. 
The android and iOS application also works really well!","For being free software, it does the job super good. The only thing vs other free counterparts is the time limit in the free version. ",,,Webex and GoToMeeting,"We chose it just because of the overall ease of using this software on a daily basis.

With the paradigm shift to the virtual world brought forth by the pandemic, I smoothly shifted to a virtual office at the comfort of my bedroom. ","I use zoom meetings almost every day to see through meetings for my team. Zoom is very effective because it works for both android and windows users, therefore team members without access to laptops or desktops can easily join. Futhermore, zoom, unlike other virtual platforms works with lower connectivity which is a plus because most people work from homes with different connectivity. Lastly, zoom allows us to record meetings for transcription and future review",I am uncomfortable with the fact that the platform does not have a timer. A timer keeps one alert especially when one has more than one meeting to see through. ,,,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,"The one attribute of zoom meetings over Microsoft teams is the stability of Zoom in different internet connectivity.  Seeing as the target individuals for the virtual teams are people from diverse geographical regions, zoom served best. "

Very impressive product.","It just works!  Easy to use, setup and get my users on board!  We just made it through Tax Season working almost entirely remotely and Zoom was essential to meeting our communication needs.","Working remotely via VPN had some challenges.  Users needed to realize they could not respond to a Zoom meeting on their remote computer, but rather on their local PC.

People were using it socially, making transition to business easy!"
184,185,“Zoom is easy to use”,Never had any problems. It just works.,Zoom has been our go to system for Webinars and online meetings even before COVID-19. Easy to install for a user and to get them on a meeting. We have talked many into the system.,"Now that Zoom is addressing ""security"" it is surprisingly *less* easy to use.  The more security, the less easy to use. ",AnyMeeting,AnyMeeting was too clunky and did not have many features. ,"GoToTraining, Jitsi and Google Meet",GotoTraining was just too expensive. The others had various feature deficiencies. 
185,186,“Zoom Is A Great Communication Tool”,"Overall, Zoom has been a great tool for our workplace, especially now that we are working from home. For the last two months our Zoom use has increased due to not having the ability to meet face to face. The video calls have helped us stay on track and up to date with projects. Since our entire team is on Zoom, communication is easy and streamlined and everyone is just one video call away.","The most appealing thing about Zoom is that if you want to have a call with someone, they do not need to have Zoom installed to communicate with you. That is a huge plus when communicating with clients on a daily basis and not having to ask them to install software for a meeting. It's also great that Zoom has chat features, including individual chats and group chats, to help streamline messages throughout the day without having to resort to email. This makes internal communication a lot quicker and eaiser.","While the chat is great, one small tweak I would like to see is if my messages were on the right while everyone else's were on the left. That would make it a little easier to visually distinguish the different parts of the conversation.",,"Zoom did not require clients to have it installed on their computers to take a call with us, unlike Skype which needs everyone to have the program installed before they can use it.",,
186,187,“Get on the Zoom bandwagon!”,"We've used Zoom Meetings for a few years now for our remote board meetings and committee calls, but I have to say that Zoom has 100% been essential for our team in the last 3 months. Love the ease of joining and starting calls. It's so easy to be chatting with someone and say ""Hey, can I share my screen with you really quickly?"" and then start a call, shoot them the link, and be screen sharing in a matter of 60-120 seconds. I also appreciate some of the interactive features (reactions, breakout rooms, etc.) a LOT.","It's honestly SO easy to start a meeting, join a meeting, schedule a meeting! The ease of this platform is what sold me even before the quarantine work from home situation. Also, just have to give a shoutout to the virtual backgrounds. I love adding my own and they've saved me many a time from messy rooms or locations I'd otherwise be shy to share.","The invite is suuuuper long. I wish when I copied the invite it was just the link -- I wish that was the default.

Most of the time, I'm getting feedback from the users I'm support on how cool it is.","Working with end users can be a struggle if they aren't on a domain and need assistance so when it comes to remote assistance, Zoom is awesome. It's easy to understand for users who aren't very savvy in the field and want something they can easily open and use. 
From download to joining a meeting, Zoom makes it easy for anyone to use. ","The only speed bumps I've run into is when the user doesn't remember their email info so when it comes to sending an invite through email, it can be rough for users who don't know the info and then have to take extra steps to reset their passwords.

Without this video conferencing tool, I'm not sure how our organization would have been able to stage engaged. ","Before the pandemic hit, our sales team used this tool to conduct introductory calls and demo presentations. This was a tool that we used at least 5 times a week. However, as soon as the pandemic hit and we were told we had to work from the office, everything changed. Overnight, Zoom became the most used tool in our tech stack by the entire company. Not just sales. It all came down to its great performance, overall stability, and a large number of features. I've used more than one conferencing tool and our organization loves how stable the platform is during our company-wide meetings (200 employees). The features steal the show. Screen sharing, camera and audio control, backgrounds, the ability to record, and unlimited chat times. All of this has been essential during the pandemic.

189,190,“The Use of Zoom Software for Educational Purposes”,"My Overall experience with Zoom is outstanding. As a tutor and tutee at the same time, Zoom has been so helpful. It offers a lot of useful and easy-to-use features that cannot be found anywhere. It is one of the best video conference platforms that I have used in education so far. Nevertheless, it has some pitfalls that need improvement. Zoom's flaws are quite inconsequential when compared to other applications, or to the advantages this software offers.
Thanks to the free 40-minute meetings, people can use it freely and judge. There is no better than a free personal experience. Maybe the free version will satisfy your needs and you will not have to purchase other features.  
","	There is a free trial for those who do not want to pay. 
	It is easy to use for both generations, the old and the new.
	It has high levels of privacy for both the tutee and the tutor. 
	It allows the inclusion of a large audience. A whole class of 40 students can join in.  
	It allows streaming webinars on Facebook, which is a unique feature that cannot be found in other similar applications. 
","	The mobile version lacks some features that are available on the desktop version. 
	It does not support Dropbox or any other application for storing data.  
	The free trial is limited to 40 minutes meetings only. If the user wishes to make a longer meeting, he will have to pay a price that is a bit higher compared to other conferencing applications.
	The quality of the image sometimes turns blurry even though there is a strong connection.

The most critical piece for me is the screensharing options. the ""Pause"" share features is extremely critical to me, as I often have to prepare other things on my screen while discussing what the viewer sees on my paused screen.

Also love the ability for the meaning host to be able to mute or unmute individuals microphones in case they have forgotten to do so and there is background noise that is interfering with our presentations. As well as the option for individual members to either use their video or not, because let's face it, some mornings while working remotely, you just started ready to be seen by a bunch of people right after you've rolled out of bed and before you finish your first cup of coffee. It truly does have an option for everyone. Now that we have it, we can't imagine how we lived without it.","Zoom has changed the way we do business. We are a small company of independent contractors living in different states across the country, and it has never been easier to get us all together for a face to face meeting, brainstorming session, or just a Friday get together. It has brought us closer, made us more effecient, and has put a face to the names of people we have communicated with interoffice on a daily basis via email, phone, and text. Could we have continued are work the old way? Sure. Would it have been as much fun, no. We absolutely love Zoom.","Personally, I think there Zoom platform works great. We have had a few issues every so often sending a meeting link and it not working automatically.

So I would say, for a few extra seconds of typing in the meeting room number and password is no big deal and is not something that any of us have issues with nor do any of our clients.

It is easy to use, accessible and perfect for fostering trusting relationships while distance learning. I know many of our students are very grateful for the time they are able to spend with us on Zoom.","Like pretty much everybody on the planet, I didn't start regularly using Zoom until the COVID-19 pandemic shut down our schools and forced us into digital learning. Prior to that time, I had attended a handful of Zoom meetings which went fine, but didn't utilize a lot of features that we have come to rely on since we accelerated our use. 

While I did not use Zoom often for instruction (I do use it for private tutoring all the time), it was very valuable to me as a tool for collaboration. I sometimes attended 12 - 15 staff meetings per day on Zoom and without it, I don't know how we could have achieved as much as we did. Having the app on my laptop made signing in and operating Zoom super easy. The platform seems relatively stable, so most of the time reception was good and I love the ShareScreen feature. The ability to show my students various media really makes the biggest difference in their lessons. They are more engaged than if they simply had to watch our presentations then respond to questions.","I think the earlier security concerns were the biggest drawback, but that seems to be less of an issue now (at least there hasn't been as much in the news).

The platform is pretty dependable and wrong; any issues usually are due to someone's personal WiFi. Mobile works well, too. The platform also lends itself to a lot of creativity; the virtual backgrounds have helped make Zoom fun, be a platform for quizzes/games/non-work related things. Chat function is also extremely useful.","The join a meeting process can actually be a bit irritating; you click out to a window, which then launches the application (and the window just stays open despite being useless after). I also have constant ""UPDATE AVAILABLE"" notices on Zoom, no matter how many times I update.",Slack,"Not sure, our IT dept made the switch. We actually still have Slack.

You can set up a free account, and with the free account you can hold brief meetings (the last time I did this, the meetings were capped at 60 minutes). However, it is a nice and inexpensive way to see if Zoom might be right for you. My advice to those seeking a digital meeting application would be to compare Zoom side by side with GotoMeeting. As stated, my experience has been that GotoMeeting is easier to navigate and learn.  My team has used GotoMeeting for years, but even early on, it was easier to use than Zoom. ","Zoom is a tool used mainly for online meetings. It's a great tool if you want to bring together remote employees. It's also valuable if you host a meeting and want to invite others outside of your organization without having to fly them to your city to meet in person. My experience with Zoom falls into this latter category. That is to say, my Zoom is experience is based on being in invitee to meetings hosted by other organizations that use Zoom. There are several features I like about Zoom. The audio quality is great as is the video quality. It's fairly easy to join a Zoom meeting (once you have the meeting credentials you simply click out on the url provided by the organizer). For audio, you can dial in or use your computer's audio system. ","As an infrequent user of Zoom, I find it to be less easy to use than GotoMeeting (which is what my company uses). The Zoom interface is less clear, and it's not quite as easy to see who is in the meeting (whereas with GotoMeeting both of these details are quite obvious because of the helpful dashboard). With Zoom, I often find myself clicking around to figure out how things work. In sum, it's less user-friendly than other digital meeting applications I've used.",,,,

From the host point of view, it is easy to access all of its features. Setting up a meeting is quick, sending out invites is easy, connecting to the meeting and starting a meeting couldn't be easier.  From the end user point of view, this system is great. It doesn't need to be installed on the user's PC by an administrator. We just click the meeting link, the meeting launches in a temporary instance, and we are good to go. There is an app for Android and iOS, but those too are easy to install. It uses whatever camera, microphone, and speakers you've got setup on your device.  We use this software as part of our Distance Learning programs. And we've used it with schools, museums, and hospitals. Think kids that are sick and cannot leave the hospital. Or kids from a landlocked state, who haven't seen the ocean. We take them on virtual tours of our Aquarium, and show them the bay and the shipping channel, and it's all LIVE VIDEO and two way communication so we can answer questions and show the kids what they want to see.  This software is so easy to use, not just for our staff, but also for educators and hospital staff. It's extremely easy for them to click a link and know the software will work without their having to call their IT staff to install software and test it over and over again.

Since I started teaching online, it has enabled me to teach students worldwide and meet potential clients from the comfort of my home. I don't need to leave my house to teach people. I can work irrespective of my location.
     Its whiteboard feature has solved the problem of communicating because I can make illustrations and express my ideas better when I use the whiteboard.
     For me, Zoom is one of the best virtual meeting software I have used. I would recommend it to anyone. I benefitted from  Zoom's fantastic features on its free plan, unlike some platforms I have used that don't give you so much.
     
  "," Zoom has been the easiest video conferencing tool I have used. It is linked with Google Calendar so I use it to schedule lessons with my students and potential clients. I have never been late or missed a meeting since I started using Zoom for my lessons and meetings.
   I use Zoom for my private tutoring company where I give English lessons to my online students. I also use it to keep in touch with my friends who live far away.
   Its video and audio quality is superb. It makes my lessons a great experience. I use its mute mic and webcam function when my students arrive so that my online class doesn't get rowdy. That helps me have better control over my sessions.
   I also use the app on my android phone to host and attend meetings with clients when I don't have access to my desktop computer. My experience has been good.
   There are times when the state of my room has been disorganized. The Zoom virtual background feature saved me the embarrassment. I used it to change my background so that my space looks more professional.
    I love its file-sharing feature because it makes it easy to share PDF files and information via chat during my lessons. When I am holding online group classes, I use its breakout room feature to put students in different rooms on Zoom where they do their classwork individually.","  I dislike its inability to record sessions on mobile for free users. I tried to record a lesson on my android phone when I was on the free plan. However, I could not even find the record session button.
    I found out later that that feature is only available to mobile users on the paid plan.
    Some other features like virtual background are unavailable on mobile devices. I couldn't find it on my android phone when I tried to use it during one of my Zoom meetings.
   Zoom doesn't run well when the internet speed is low. It ends meetings when a participant's internet connection is weak, irrespective of the internet connection of other participants. That happened to me during my lessons sometimes and disrupted my classes.
   Zoom also limits meeting time to 40 minutes on the free plan. I find this inadequate for online lessons.",,,,
204,205,“Zoom Classroom/Staff Meeting Review”,This software made it easy to check up and fill in employees in a virtual way with a personal touch. It was a good way to catch face time with the employees while being in the comfort of our own offices.,"This software made it easy to schedule, host and organize meetings. As a security feature it allowed my team to remove or add employees as necessary which made performance reviews easy and relatively stress free.

It was also very easy to share information either in the chat or with direct screen sharing; the direct in chat feature was great for sending personal messages to staff without disrupting the meeting flow or ""calling them out.""","Zoom requires a stable network connection for all users to be live and up to speed. This is not overly a problem on Zoom's end but in order to stay active with video meetings hosting 5+ people, a network supporting 150mbps minimum must be used to ensure a flawless Zoom experience.",Anywhere365,It was easier to construct meetings with Zoom.,"Google Meet, Anywhere365 and Blackboard Collaborate","It was easier to use, was downloadable by all users with out any hassles and Zoom overall provided a positive impact on the work environment."
205,206,“Teaching on Zoom”,"Overall though after trying many different softwares and looking at the cost effectiveness of using Zoom, I would recommend using zoom to most people who are trying to teach or tutor online. It is great to have your own meeting ID and password to give to clients, and even though some features could be better, it works well overall. ","The feature that I love most about Zoom Meetings is the ability to have a meeting with students one on one for free. It makes the cost of tutoring online much lower than using most of the softwares that are available out there that are specific to tutoring or teaching online. It also makes it much more affordable to undertake the cost if I ever have groups. I also love that there is a waiting room that you can choose to use so that when clients join it sends them there before it allows them in the meeting. When people are late it makes it easier to keep tabs on that trend. The other features that I appreciate are the whiteboard, the ability to share your screen, and the ability to bookmark links that I need to share frequently. ","There are some features that do not work to their greatest potential. One of those features is the ability to share your screen. While I love having this capacity in general, it glitches A LOT. There are even some days that it won't work correctly at all, or certain apps (like PowerPoint) that if opened when sharing cause it to crash every time. I believe that this could be greatly improved upon. I also think that the whiteboard could be better and that in general there could be more intuitive setting options. ",,,,
206,207,“Zoom Works for Most Meetings”,Overall Zoom has been create for us especially in COVID times when many of us are working from different locations. It has been great to get the entire time on the Zoom account for a reasonable cost and give everyone the ability to host and join meetings.,One of the features that I like most about Zoom is the waiting room. There are times when you want to be able to admit every attendee in at the same time so it is nice to have the waiting room before a meeting starts. It is also nice that you can create a meeting room with a customer URL (your name) so you can set up reoccuring meetings with the same easy to remember dial in and link.,"It is difficult to toggle when there are a large number of people in a meeting room. Also, having the ability to fade the background out without changing the background to another image is something that I would love for Zoom to improve on.",,,Google Meet and GoToMeeting,"I used to use GoToMeeting at a different company and had issues with it.

They are very reliable, fast, and mostly integrable with all your CRMs and software.","Zoom has been the most interactive and user-friendly video conferencing and chat software that I've used so far. Zoom is widely integrable with most calendar apps and makes it easy for you to schedule meeting with your clients and invite others to screen sharing sessions. We use Zoom internally for chat purposes, we love the client zoom app and all its functions. You can star important messages, go back in time to search for the previous conversion by just typing a keyword. And extra points for the GIF library. And lastly, auto-recording meetings are so useful.","I think an area of opportunity is that when using the Zoom softphone, you can not host a video conference while you are on the phone line with the clients. I had some clients that are on their phone and want to talk over the phone and just screen share on their computer, some of them don't have a mic on the computers, therefore it works for them to use their mobile phone.

","Ease of video call with this tool is great, but its important feature is ""Scree Sharing"". One can share their screen and sound with all the participants, so its like presenting to all at the same time without physically being there.
Data flow is encrypted to have a secure sharing environment. 
Participants and host can chat among each other by text or video responses. Moreover, host has many feature that control the audience.
Recording is also quite an impressive feature but only available for paid version. ","Reconnecting or change in network can often lead the particpant to leave the meeting. Meanwhile, participant may miss information like earlier chat replies or ongoing presentations.
There may be nuisance if all the participants were to provide their opinion all at once.

Like the title says, it's not perfect but it gets the job done (most of the time).","Zoom has been super beneficial to use with my current work. I especially enjoy the fact that you don't need others to install Zoom if they are just joining for a one-time meeting. The Chrome Extension also makes it really easy to call a meeting and invite others to it without having to go through the main page. The feature I use the most is the add-on to Google Calendars. When adding a Zoom link to a calendar event, you can customize just about everything you need to and makes it easy for others to join.
","Just like with all other software and technology based products, it isn't perfect. I have had calls dropped on occasion and sometimes the recording feature doesn't work. But other than those two issues, Zoom has been a great product to use.

213,214,“The remote working enabler”,"We used Zoom for about 6 months before moving our team to fully remote. Having an easy, performant, and rich communications client, such as we have found with Zoom, enabled this transition to be as straightforward and disruption-free as possible. ","With Zoom, you're able to have persistent rooms for scheduled meetings as well as the ability to spin up ad-hoc meetings for quick catchups. The social affordances of these two meeting types are somehow maintained and communication feels as natural as face to face.  Very little and infrequent lag or jitter and the different presenter views and sharing options seem to cover all needs. ","I do like the emoticons and stamps on shared screens as a way to feel involved and seek feedback, however this can become a bit excessive. A quick and easy way for the host of the call to remove or turn off stamps would be appreciated. Alternatively, perhaps making stamps much shorter lived would alleviate this issue.

We may only use Zoom for screen sharing.,Well at least like about the software Is that there's no exact way for when a client can't find the meeting code or if the meeting code doesn't work that there's not another method for them to join the meeting.

5- with its webcam feature & Screen sharing feature make it the best solution for online virtual business meetings 
6- It is accessible from all 3 formats , 1-Desktop 2-Online 3-Mobile application
7- Its provides option to record the meeting for later use and for those who are not present in the meeting.
8- it offers the administrator (one who organized the meeting ) exclusive rights and controls in order to maintain a conducive environment  (Eg  mike control of other members, expelling rights etc)
9- Most importantly it offers the members a 'hand raising' option, in order to avoid cross talking and ambiguous environment
","1-  only one thing i dislike, that any member attending the meeting can see other members too, there must me a option for administrator to make classes of categories in the same meeting. i mean two audience rooms. for example take girls and boys example- in the same meeting there must be an option for admin to segregate to classes, boys should not see girls and girls should not see boys but administrator should have access to both",,,,
217,218,“An alternative to communicate”,"The best tool to give presentations about business, virtual classes and group connections.

It is a very stable tool with a high quality. Since I use it, I do not even open my Skype.","Zoom seems to me a very good program as an alternative for all those people who use videoconferencing a lot. Some use Hangouts, others Skype, and it depends on what you as a user are looking for.

What I like most about Zoom is that it is a program that you can use to give a more business aspect to your presentations or virtual meetings since there are few people who know this application that has nothing to envy to Skype. In fact it seems a thousand times more stable and much more intuitive to use.

One of the features that I like most about this application is that it assigns you a unique room number (it would be something like your identification in the application). With this number you will be able to invite partners, friends, family, clients and potential prospects to connect to your room through this number. For example, my room has a number, that is, if someone enters that ID on the platform, it would be connected to my room.

Now, other things that I like about the application is the notification that is sent when someone tries to enter your room, before you have opened it.

I choose between Zoom and Skype, I would choose Zoom a thousand times.","Like any application, there is a paid version and a free version.

The only bad thing about having the free version is that you have a limit of 40 minutes each time you open your room. That is to say that if your presentation lasts 1 hour, after 40 minutes it will close and you will have to reopen it to finish the presentation.

So if you need more than 40 minutes to use your room I blindly recommend that you pay for the premium version. It will give you unlimited time and your capacity of participants in the room will increase considerably.",,,,

The quality of the audio and video is great, and is above all other conferencing methods our office has used in the past.

We've been able to host team bonding events on Zoom (eg. Murder Mystery Parties) and that would not have been possible without its features!","After COVID began and my company moved online, we relied on Zoom daily to stay connected to our team and our clients. The quality of the call is unparalleled (at least in comparison to other similar software I've used, including Microsoft teams, Skype, Google Hangouts, Discord). It's easy to use and doesn't require the other use to install the Zoom app. It works well on mobile devices as well, meaning I can take my calls to-go easily. I love how polling can be incorporated into meetings as well and I love the reactions that we can use. The recent update with filters also adds a fun element to our meetings. Lastly, I love the ability to record our meetings directly to the cloud.   ","The only complaint I have at the moment is that I'm unable to use Zoom virtual backgrounds. I've updated my computer and ensured that all the specs supports this feature.

I also like the raise hand function because it simulates the feeling of being in class and being called on by the professor.  Another function I like is breakout rooms, since it lets you speak one on one with professors or other classmates.  I like that you can hold the spacebar to temporarily mute yourself for a second or two -- that is very useful. ","I think screen sharing needs improvement at some points (although it works well for the most part). I find that as an animation student it is just tough to share your screen and be able to have the other participant view your work in real time and in the correct FPS.  I also find that sometimes the volume gets adjusted randomly without my knowledge and I am unable to hear the speaker.  For example, once I shared my screen and suddenly was not able to hear my professor as he gave me feedback.  There was another incident where I changed my profile photo and without my knowledge, a setting was turned off where I was automatically muted when joining meetings. ",,,,

240,241,“Zoom Meetings for elearning with Deaf Students”,"Zoom made the pandemic much more efficient and allowed students to pivot into a more interactive, personalized and deaf-friendly educational setting. Because some students are English Language Learners (meaning it's not their first language) they thrived with access to American Sign Language (ASL) instead of only reading English-written texts. 

Zoom allowed for collaboration, professional development, attendance of webinars and trainings for teachers (some of which, in a regular year, cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to attend due to transportation and lodging) and remote learning during the pandemic. Seeing teacher's and student's faces was invaluable during such a tumultuous time, and allowed students to continue their learning, albeit in a new way.","Zoom was a lifesaver during remote learning for teachers and students alike. Everyone enjoyed the video features, as seeing each other was critical for engaged learning, content teaching, demonstrations and collaborations. Zoom provided accessibility for deaf users and deaf educators to fluidly communicate with deaf students through clear video conferencing, as well as allowed screen sharing to demonstrate and guide students through technical problems.","Zoom obviously requires internet access, and a decent speed and bandwidth, so getting hot spots to students became an issue, depending on transportation, and parent's availability. If it's possible to require less bandwidth/speed, Zoom could have been even more powerful because there would be less distractions and suspension of teaching because of freezing, lagging or completely shutting down.",,,,

It has been the cornerstone around which my e-learning classroom has been built and I mean it genuinely when I say that it has become an essential tool for anyone hoping to be in the online learning community. ,"Zoom is incredibly easy to use. I have used this software with students under the age of 8 and guardians over the age of 70. It is also vital for the online educational arena in the modern age. There is no better software resource for welcome a group of individuals together in one location than Zoom. The easy access for all users, the intuitive design, and the breakout rooms are just a few of the wonderful features that augment the online learning process. ","The feature that I believe can be most improved with Zoom is their interactions with students while they are in a breakout room. At the moment you can make ""announcements"" that go across different breakout rooms, but it would be much better to be able to send chat messages to them - exactly the same as how the host can send a private chat to anyone in the waiting room. Similarly, once a host has opened the breakout rooms they cannot toggle the ""students choose room"" or ""automatically assign"" feature, and cannot easily remove a student and place them back in the main room.

It also helped hybrid classes (in person some days, remote other days) to function.   Moreover, my university has one of the largest deaf/hard of hearing communities in the US.  A critical reason my institution picked Zoom was its real time closed-caption support. We extensively used it. ","Zoom should have more user defined hot keys.  Ctl-C brings up the chat window, but there is not a similar hot key for annotations. Annotations are critical in teaching.

We have dozens of employees who had never used a virtual conferencing system before, and they were all up and running, competently, within 1 day. The customization options, specifically the waiting room and group meeting options are incredibly helpful, as is the scheduling of multiple, recurring meetings over time.  The recent HIPAA compliance has also been a huge help, especially in the current  Covid environment.","The only drawback I have found in Zoom is the occasional glitches with audio and/or video connecting on the user/guest end.

The attendees of the Zoom call are not able to mute other attendees and only the host has the option to do so. This could be very frustrating as some attendees are disruptive whether that is on purpose or not. This makes it very hard for some people to learn and to teach etc. Another feature that could be useful is to ban the bots that join servers to disrupt calls. There are people out there that put bots into calls that play loud sounds and music etc. This could be very frustrating even for the host because there are way too many bots to get rid of in a short amount of time and a lot of the times the call needs to be ended and started again which is very time consuming and not everyone has such time especially business owners and teachers as they have  to follow a strict schedule.,Google Meet,Google meets is lacking behind Zoom by a long shot because Zoom simply has a lot of features and ease of use etc. Zoom also has more users to back that up. ,,

It allows me to connect with my students and hear their voices almost as clearly as in person. Setting up meetings is easy, and sharing the links and/or meeting IDs with my students has been easy as well. I've done some group classes with Zoom and had success with them as well. Also, I've recently discovered the ""hide self"" view, which is a great way to minimize distractions during lessons. ","Over the course of the past few months the policies have seemed to change rather frequently (adding mandatory passcodes for meetings, then eliminating that requirement, and audio settings changing, for example).

At a previous company I used WebEx and did not like he interface or the video quality. Zoom works easily and has features which make it great for taking online classes (i.e. the raise hand button, the breakout rooms, etc). During this difficult time of early 2020, it has made it possible for even tech illiterate professors to meet with their students. 

The main things I like are, in no particular order: the ease of scheduling meetings; the user interface; and the high quality of video/audio.","There are some negatives. On a user interface side, the fact that the aforementioned ""raise hands"" and ""yes""/""no"" buttons are under the participants window is very confusing. It took me multiple classes before I figured this out. This would be my only complaint about the usability.

From a security perspective, I find Zoom lacking. It is not end to end encrypted and also lacks protection against ""Zoom Bombing"" besides the password feature. As a security researcher, I think you need better automatic features to protect against the attacks which malicious internet users are levying. Only one of my professors has actively worked to prevent Zoom bombing, while the rest are still vulnerable. They should not be expected to know how to protect themselves.",Webex,Switched companies.,,

It's widely used so there are  less issues with new people not knowing how to join calls and interact with the system. I usually use Microsoft Teams since we have an Office account and the integrations with Office apps is huge bonus but Zoom is always my next choice if Teams won't work for some reason.","Easy to set up and implement, though at times users were confused on if they should download the Zoom application or view the conference in the browser. That is more of a user issue than a app issue however. The video clarity is strong with Zoom and our attendees have shown up well in their video conferences Audio is clear and crisp as well. Attendees can attend meetings from multiple devices so they don't have to be tied to a physical location to attend a meeting. Meetings can be recorded and saved for viewing later. The features on the free plan is very generous and can handle most of what is required for most teams.","Security was an issue but Zoom has made plans to update the security to protect it's users.

That is why I recommend this application for meetings in every sense.","It is a very simple software to use and that makes it different from other similar applications. Its main menu groups the 4 main functions that one wants to do, such as: enter a meeting, create a new meeting, schedule meetings and schedule them for the future and screen sharing that is very useful in business conferences, in education or Projects.
It is very light when it comes to consuming system resources, the interaction between the host and the audience is very good, since it has many ways in which it can be shared, be it through emojis, annotation tools on the screen, a chat, surveys , raise your hand, among others.
The free version is undoubtedly very good, but its payment plan is very cheap unlike other applications. In conclusion, when creating online meetings, I recommend Zoom for its ease of use and its good interaction between the members of the room.","As a negative point to this application is that many users cannot share screen at the same time.

It doesn't take much internet bandwidth up so even if someone has a shoddy connection at the moment it will generally still work, and the ability to turn your webcam on and off helps in case you need to show you are away for a short break like using the restroom. Generally it is protocol to have the webcam on if you are at the screen in the companies I've used Zoom with, and I feel that's a woirthwhile policy. Being ""on air"" lends some of the physicality of a real work space back to the virtual meeting environment. ","The video calls are easy to set up and navigate. They can be password protected so nobody intrudes which adds some extra safety if you need one on one time with another team member. Links can be sent through email, with meetings able to be recurring which is a great feature when you might have meetings at the same time for a week or month at a time.  Zoom can detect both a webcam from a laptop or external webcam in addition to allowing audio input with a set of headphones, I have rarely had trouble with it doing the hardware check. My favorite feature would have to be the virtual backgrounds, they can make your video feed brigher or can be set to a more neutral space than your room of choice like substituting for an official corporate background.","The mute feature is quick and reliable but on occasion it has slight mishaps like being mapped to a keyboard button in addition to the clicked area on the screen which can lead to accidentally unmuting.

It's worth the fee if you're getting the Pro account (to get more than 40 minutes). Still definitely much better than its 'free' competitors.","I particularly love how easy it is to break people out into ""rooms"", and how actions are intuitive. Even our senior pastors who are not tech savvy are able to grasp immediately how to do things in Zoom.","Fee is a bit steep if you're not using it very frequently (e.g. for classes or meetings that only run once a week).

It solves the problem of technological Luddite-ry with its ease of use and user friendly platform. As I said above, it really is my first choice when it comes to meetings.","I love how easy it is to use this software. It is basically fool proof. It's easy to join meetings, it's easy to invite people to meetings, it's easy to add meetings to calendars, you name it, it's easy! The video quality is also always top notch, as is the sound quality. I like that reactions have been added, and that it is easy to raise a hand. Additionally, I like that the chat feature is always available as a side panel as opposed to a pop out. Generally speaking, this seems to me to be the most user-friendly of video conferencing applications out there, which is incredibly important given that video conferencing is going to be very prevalent in our lives going forward.","Honestly, the thing that I like least about this product is that an individual user would have to pay for an account.

So from that aspect, if you don't need people to host long meetings, the value is great. The overall experience is that if you just need a video call platform without a lot of other fancy stuff with calendars and tight integration into Outlook, then Zoom works great. The plugins/extensions they provide can only do so much.","Stability and quality of the video stream is the standout feature of Zoom. In previous roles I've used Teams (a lot), Chime (yes, it's a real thing from Amazon, and it's just awful), Google Meet and none of them can compare with the call quality in both audio and video and instability, that is almost never does zoom drop a call. Especially when I compare it with the car quality in Slack, zoom really shines. We don't have an issue with the number of attendees and the  audio to video synchronization is always spot on as well.","The overall interface in Zoom is much better than Amazon chime, but it still lacks a lot compared to teams, which is counterintuitive because Teams is actually much cheaper if you have an office 365 subscription anyways. Everything from screensharing to doing PowerPoints is much better in Teams, so Zoom really needs to work on their overall UX if they want to keep getting market share.",,,,
268,269,“Zoom review”,"I like a lot features associated with this platform. While in a group training, you can send message to everyone or just someone in the group. You can add people in the group training any time. and can mute them, if they have noise in their backgrounds. I found these features quite useful because a lot of other similar platform do not have these features. I strongly recommend everyone who want to have online communication with employers and other job related activities during this pandemic to use Zoom to conduct their daily activities. ","This app is so much useful for online meeting, sessions, interviews, training and many more purposes especially during Covid-19. It help us communicate effectively with many features that some other platforms do not have some of these features. I personally like Zoom because, I have been using this software for training, sessions and interviews and I found it quite simple and useful with so many good features. ","I like a lot of features in this platform, but beside so many good features, I would like to mention that sometimes, it is a bit confusing to adjust the screen during online session. This might be the result of not knowing how to adjust it, but I found it a little bit difficult to adjust the screen the way I wanted it during presentations. Other than that, this platform is reliable, user friendly and quite useful especially during this pandemic. ",,,,
269,270,"“Good platform support, but lacking in some features”","Zoom is very valuable for holding online meetings, but lacks features such as advanced noise suppression, and automated live captioning. It is very reliable, and widely supported on all sorts of systems.","It's available everywhere, from the web interface to Windows and Linux apps, mobile apps, Chromebook apps, and even an option to join meetings with a phone call. It has been very reliable, I haven't experienced any downtime or connection issues at all. It also has good security features, with meeting hosts being able to lock down meetings, restrict them to institution users only, and vet users before allowing them into the meeting. It also has a lot of options for screen sharing, allowing you to share the whole desktop or specific applications. It also isn't very heavy on performance, so you can easily run it even on an old machine.","The built-in noise reduction is very lacking compared to what RNNoise and Krisp can do. Others would hear my computer fans and keyboard noise all the time. What's worse in my opinion is that there is no automated captioning (e.g. speech-to-text AI). Zoom allows you to hand-write captions in real time, but that's not realistic in my opinion. What is weird is that if you record your meeting to the cloud, Zoom does analyze and generate captions for the meeting, but that happens hours after the meeting was done and not in real-time. Additionally, I experience issues with the desktop application freezing when switching microphones, for example trying to switch from my laptops on-board microphone to a headset causes the application to freeze, and in some cases even crashes it.",,,,

We have hundreads of sister companies throughout North America, and while we are seperate business entities , we typically share a lot of the same functions and goals. Before, Zoom Meetings and Chat, directors would wait and rely on country wide conferences to meet and collarborate with their collegues. As you can imagine, doing this once per year certainly isn't enough. Not to mention, the vast expenses that come with traveling to and attending a conference.

This is where Zoom Meeting & Chat has found its niche with us. Unlike other forms of video conferences, you are able to meet with multiple people at once. Someone is also idnetified as the coordinator and they can send out the invitations, which then can be added to your calendar so you never miss a meeting! Some of the best features are that the names of the people are on the screen since you are often meeting with new faces or people that you've only met a time or too. The individual boxes of the person that is speaking lights up so it is easy to follow along. So long as your computer is equipped with a microphone and a camera, you're good to go! 

Our program now has a set monthly meeting with many directors from around the country. We share ideas, share group readings, discuss research, and are greatly benefitting from our larger community thanks to Zoom Meetings & Chat.

1. You can integrate zoom into your calendar. So when I plan a meeting, I can add the zoom link/information in the invite as well. (I used to have to send two calendar invites).
2. I use this for meetings as well as to facilitate workshops. When I'm running a workshop, I can integrate polls, use thumbs up/down to see if everyone is on board, I can put participants in breakout groups to have small discussions, and then bring everyone back to the larger group.
3. If it's a session you'd like for others to see that couldn't attend, you can also record it.

368,369,“Easy to use but resource hungry”,I have had a pleasant experience with zoom with collaborative sessions with less than 10 participants. The interface is very clean and the features are rich. ,"The software is excellently designed with aesthetically pleasing layout and easy to use GUI. I love the self recording feature as this allowed me to record lectures for an Engineering course. Moreover the recorded lectures are optimally compressed by Zoom and I love the final video quality.  Another feature that I like is the whiteboard, that is a powerful took with a stylus/drawing tablet for explaining/collaborating in a classroom (office hours)..","While the software runs well on desktops, my Surface Pro 3 would overheat after running for just 20-30 mins with a class of 20 students with recording turned on. The overheating issue is so severe that it would shut down my surface. You can easily open the resource/performance monitor from the task-manager and check that Zoom is hogging all my processor resources.",Google Meet,Zoom was much more feature rich than Google meet.,,

This is so useful because if you want some privacy this software bring you the opportunity of that. Zoom does not have issues with audio or video, almost all the times would be the internet connection.","It is a payable software, so maybe Zoom would not have so many people such like another videocall softwares such like Google or Microsoft Teams that are free to use. You can use Zoom free, but you will not have the same tools and your videocalls will be limited to 40 minutes. A lot of users had reported that the tool that let the administrator turn on their cameras without autorization of the users are a very risk privacy issue.",Google Classroom,,,
370,371,"“The standard for videoconferencing, whether you like it not”","Zoom is a product that we can't avoid. There is no other videoconferencing platform with such wide adoption, with good reason: it's powerful and functional. However, it (like all software) is imperfect, and the average non-business user might benefit from a simpler, free software. For businesses, Zoom Pro is a good (and possibly the only) choice.","Everyone and their grandma uses Zoom nowadays. It's mostly plug-and-play; you click the Zoom link, download the application if you haven't already, and you're in. There's a full suite of features to share your screen, control participant interactions, and exchange files and information via annotations and chat. These features make it a powerful tool for virtual productivity, both in large conferences and in one-on-one tutoring.","The UI isn't the most beautiful, and business users realistically need their premium service. The menus are often difficult to navigate: there's a settings button that I can never seem to access while in the call, a number of buttons along the bottom that expand into further menus, and so many features scattered in every corner of the application. Streamlining menus would do a lot for the user experience; why are Security, Record, and Reactions at the same level of prominence? I personally find myself searching online to find how to navigate the settings for something that should be intuitive.",,,,
371,372,“industry standard”,"Remote working requires video meeting software. Zoom is the most widely used so it's just easy to integrate teams who are already comfortable and used to the Zoom user interface. All video meeting software is dependent on internet connections and background conditions and Zoom is no exception, so video meetings in general can be tedious.","Most businesses have zoom now so it's easy to integrate remote teams together. It's so widely used that it's often the easiest way to connect with teams who are already comfortable with zoom. Meetings can be simple with just face to face sessions or they can have features like interpretation, break outs (the new breakout interface is much easier), and polls. The in-session features are all really easy to set up and easy to interface with.",Zoom bombings are pretty common. Some of the upgraded features like security are a bit hard to navigate and you have to go to the website to find those features. Features that you have to go to the website for are a little harder to deploy than in-session standard features.,,"We still use Google Meets, but Zoom is better for more complex meetings that require breakout rooms. I have noticed that Google Meets now has a breakout room feature, but I didn't realize that till much later and I don't think it has as many features as Zoom.",,
372,373,“Fun to use!!!”,My overall experience has been good. My company started using Zoom when the pandemic hit and everyone had to work remote. Since then zoom improved a lot of their features to make it more fun and useful. I like that they've different versions that you can buy based on your needs. I just wish they'll at least loosen up the limitations on the basic version.,"The one thing I personally like is that you can mirror your video for meetings. This feature is a boon for people (like me) who feel like their one side of the face looks better than the other on video. The ability to upload any image or video as your virtual background is also great. These days when we're working from home with all kinds of messy and boring backgrounds, these virtual backgrounds are really helpful to look profession or fun during the meetings.",Most of the cool and helpful features are only available with the paid version. Basic version (the free one) has very limited options. The basic version also has limitations on the meeting duration as well as number of participants. ,,I still have access to the older tool but most of the meetings I schedule and attend are on Zoom. Our company is using both. We made the switch during pandemic as the other tool was unable to cater to our drastically changed virtual working needs.,,

It's incredibly simple to integrate with Google Calendar to arrange and send a link, and the call recording feature of the paid version we use is a lifesaver. Anything is tailored to meet the requirements of the majority of companies. Our organization's members live all over Africa and Zoom allows us to have face-to-face meetings even though the Covid pandemic and lockdowns make it very difficult yet Management meetings became possible thru the power of Zoom","This is a very interesting issue, and I must say  I have no problem with the Zoom creation team not including these capabilities, but one of the barriers to us using Zoom for meetings is that - there is no incorporated system for secret balloting during Management and Board voting on issues in a completely electronic meeting.

376,377,“Great communication tool ”,Great overall experience and a very useful tool for remote teams both professionally and as a form of casual catch ups. The only improvement I would suggest would be to allow multiple admins to log in to the same basic paid account. This is a function we'd be happy to pay for per admin user without the huge cost of upgrading especially when used within a smaller company ,This software has great functionality with the ability to split into rooms and write messages during a call. It is used regularly in our company and we don't have any major issues with it. Connectivity has always been good with great sound quality and generally quite self explanatory ,When diving into the settings of calls some of our users find it difficult to locate the setting they need such as allowing participants to enter the room before the host. It is also difficult when the host either has to leave early or their connection breaks so the meeting is ended for all participants unless settings have been changed or co hosts selected ,,,Microsoft Teams,Better connection and ease of use 
377,378,“Best video conferencing tool”,"Zoom is a great video conferencing tool.  I use it daily for internal work meetings, as well as, to provide product demonstrations to potential clients.  I like that I have my own personal Zoom meeting link to provide to my clients.  I also like that I am able to record all my demonstrations and save them to the cloud or my computer.  It allows me to share my screen and for the other meeting attendees to share their screen as well.  All the features of Zoom are easy to use and provide me a very powerful tool to connect with people virtually.  The newest features that allow you to lock your meeting or even have a waiting room have been extremely beneficial when I have back-to-back meetings scheduled.  It allows me to use the same link without worrying about someone joining my Zoom meeting that isn't supposed to be part of that meeting.  Being that I work in Healthcare, this is extremely important for meeting HIPAA requirements in the case there is sensitive information showing on my screen or another attendees screen. ","Easy to use, can set up different rooms, can record the meetings, and a great video conferencing tool for personal and business use!

These features helped us in gaining the audience and simplifying the process. ","Zoom was one of the first choices we had in mind when selecting a platform for online meetings and sessions dusting the lockdown. Our main reasons for going with Zoom was it's intuitive UI which is simple and accessible for any a beginner and experienced user. It has some extra features when compared to other conferencing platforms, like the ability to write on top on of screen, scheduling multiple meetings, chat with a specific individual during a meeting etc.","The meeting recording is created with an unfamiliar video format due to which it has to be processed and converted to conventional formats such as MP4 for uploading it on any social media. One more thing which we didn't like was that any user can join the meeting with any name, disturb the meeting and leave. The meeting organizer won't be able to find his info.",,,Google Meet and Webex,Cisco had a very small userbase which limited our audience and Google meet lacked some of the features.

379,380,“Good App for video meeting and all”,Meeting rooms are the best things. Here a group of people can be divided into different rooms. I was able to take knowledge transfer very easily on the zoom app. We can go live on this app and share our meeting experience all around the world.,"Meeting rooms are a very nice feature. Here we can divide the people into different groups for discussion. Also, sending private messages to any participants while in a meeting is also a good feature. Raising hands is also a good feature. One can raise a hand to notify others who wants to speak rather than just speaking creating chaos. If you don't want to install software then one can simply use the web app. This is also a good option. It saves space and tension-free features. It even works on low internet speed. We can also share a particular app window on the zoom rather than sharing the whole desktop, which is good for privacy.","Sometimes audio lags and also internet speed is good it shows the internet is unstable. Also, it's a little bit tough to share multiple screens. Sometimes echos come when the speaker and mic are not disabled from the other side. Also, a background noise cancellation system is not there. File sharing is still not available. I think they have to work more on it. Control sharing feature can be improved, as it's a little bit tedious to do this.",,,,

Likewise, it's advantageous to utilize. It works incredible, and in this manner, the highlights are sufficient for any group meeting. We use it week by week.","I love that I can run for all intents and purposes my entire business by means of Zoom and are accomplishing for an assortment of years now. We use Zoom at work solely for gatherings with individual associates and customers the same, there's no better programming. it is simple for numerous colleagues to utilize, paying little heed to their areas. Simple to use for everyone and incredible highlights.","It is to some degree hard to send a call for interest to different members, particularly looking through programming to rehash the connection.

With Covid - many of our in person meetings were pushed into Zoom and the transition was seamless!,Integrating with our other softwares was easy - I do wish that Zoom had more of a calling platform as well.

I am a current student and I went from never hearing what Zoom was to now having used it everyday or the last month (sometimes even 3x a day). I love how easy Zoom is you are able to hop on, share screens and so much more. I like the security of it also - giving a password as well as a link to enter. This is important as some times meetings get big so you wouldn't be able to tell If someone random joined your session. I also use it for leisure time currently, to talk with friends. My friends and I get one like once a week and play games. ",The one thing that I don't like is the time limit. I know sometimes you are able to go longer than the limited 45 minutes however that doesn't happen often. I also don't like how you can't change the sizes of the videos of others. ,,"Zoom was a lot easier to figure out, having to adjust to class online it was vital that the transition was quick.

With the implementation of Zoom in the company where I work we have cut a lot of time and we have avoided making many personal meetings that usually take more planning time. Zoom opens paths to have a free space where work teams can have a better experience of sharing experiences and projects in common.

Remote work is greatly simplified with Zoom. With your first uses you will notice that it is a fast, safe and reliable online meeting platform. These are characteristics that are difficult to achieve, at least together, in other similar alternatives. I would tell them that if they took a walk through the other similar applications, but it is better that they start with Zoom so that they save time of experience that they will live with the meetings made with Zoom. Zoom evolves to the rhythm of communications.",I can say that Zoom is a very secure online platform. I have used it in many opportunities and it has always left us with a good impression. Security has to do with compatibility with many popular third-party software. That gives greater confidence when setting up online meetings and at the same time they have a connectivity that no other application can give. I feel very pleased with the use of Zoom. It is an experience of another level.,"The mobile version hundred that falls short with the features they offer. Actually you can tell the difference with respect to the application for desktop computers. When working with the mobile version, the same quality of experience is not felt and this causes the session to have some limitations, which does not happen when a conversation is made from the PC. It is not a great nuisance but the idea is to have the same level of experience in both cases.",,,,

On the other hand, there's also Webex, Slack video, FB messenger with video, Skype - all of which are pretty robust, but just lack the same network effect as Zoom.","1. Ease of use - click on a link and you're in the meeting
2. Feature rich - screen sharing, whiteboard, custom participants views, chats, breakout rooms, etc.
3. Cross-org available - everyone uses it or knows how to use it, both within the company and between companies","1. Adding people or sharing the zoom invite from the zoom meeting itself is unnecessarily cumbersome
2. Whiteboard still needs a lot of work to be usable
3. Deeper integrations with work tools like Outlook and Slack would be great (e.g. chat inside zoom feels redundant if the org uses Slack)",Webex,"The switch was made as a company wide policy, primarily due to lower price and ease of use considerations",,
402,403,“The most reliable video meetings”,Overall Zoom comes highly recommended - we are really happy as do our clients tend to be with the range of features and the quality of calls.,"Zoom is primarily reliable - video meetings are notoriously difficult to keep online without dropping out or people having technical problems, but aside from user-error we have found Zoom to be by far the most reliable out of the the main providers out there.",There have been some issues with security but that is the case across the board for all or most of the suppliers. We have found them to be reactive to this and quickly roll out security patches.,,Skype became unreliable and unsecure.,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,Reliability primarily.
403,404,“Easy to Use”,Zoom has allowed me to connect with my clients and my coworkers easily during the Pandemic. Learning how to use the tools has been fairly intuitive-- though more advanced options take time and trial-error (like using a powerpoint slide as your background!).,"I love the ability to call in and video in. The screenshare options are awesome-- particularly ""portion of screen"" which allows me to have multiple things open and visible at once, but only show my participants the part I want them to see.  I also really enjoy being able to have multiple links-- I have a ""zoom room"" for meetings, a different room for workshop events, etc.","It requires a solid internet connection, and it's not always clear when the participants are having issues with their internet-- the ""your internet is unstable"" message only shows to the user, not the host. I also sometimes have issues with being signed out of my zoom randomly, even during a call (probably about every other week).",Google Hangouts,Zoom had more features and fewer bugs.,,
404,405,“Why use zoom meeting & chat ”,"We can easily manage our meeting with staff on distance. It helps alot during covid 19 as it was free of cost during pendamic.
We also delivered our lectures and complete our coursea and students got  virtual class and satisfied like physical class. ",Zoom meeting and chat is user friendly software. It can be installed very easily by students of grade 1 and 2.  A teacher can easily take her/his classes by setting class and password. Can check who is Taking classes or not. Can maintain attendence. ,"The attendence sheet should be generated.
Students should be submitted there assignments or quizzes ND grade maintenance are also included. ",Google Classroom,,,It provides extra features and easy to use. 
405,406,“Zoom-Is it really that great?”,"Overall, my experience with Zoom has been positive. I continue to use the software on a regular basis and have very few issues with it. I like that the interface is so user friendly so that people of every age are able to use it. It has made my business possible during the pandemic. ","Zoom does have some helpful features like being able to record meetings, having your own personal meeting room is also nice especially for me when I have one meeting right after another and it helps the individual I am meeting with know that I need to move on to the next meeting. Overall I haven't had many issues with Zoom.",One of the capacities that I use Zoom for is virtual voice lessons. I often times have the singer's sound cut out even though both of our internet connections are good and I have fiddled around with the audio settings. I also wish their customer support was more helpful. I often can't find the answer to my problem on their FAQ page. ,,"New hype about Zoom, poor connection with Skype. ",,
406,407,“Keeping Us Connected in a Disconnected World”,"Overall, Zoom is a great tool to keep people connected and engaged. It provides an arm's-length personal connection in a digital and distanced world, keeping my business and education on track. Its intuitive design and cross-device compatibility are truly amazing!","This software is vital for my everyday operations, business activity, and trainings. It has also recently proven to be a quintessential element in my personal life, as well. During these days of shutdowns and a general unwillingness for business partners and clients to meet with other people in public or in offices, Zoom has provided a steady, reliable platform to keep our conversations going in a professional and competent way thanks to its helpful features and stability. Its design and use are intuitive even for the technologically-challenged, and it is easy to use on smart phones, tablets, and computers seamlessly.","For the times when I have a slow internet connection, it would be helpful if I could turn off the video images for the meeting attendees who aren't speaking in order to save bandwidth. I would also like there to be an option to have multiple devices assigned to one user/profile during a call.",,,,
407,408,“Best-in-class video meeting platform... but could be better...”,"Zoom allows our business to hold meetings with vendors that we wouldn't normally be able to hold during the pandemic.  The experience has been great and even after the pandemic, I anticipate our business continuing to use Zoom meetings to cut down on travel expenses and to allow for easy screen sharing and collaboration.","I love Zoom - well as much as person can love Zoom in a pandemic.  The paid versions of the software have great features - like the ability to allow users to call into the meetings, easy meeting invites by text messages and e-mail, and advanced features like the ability to have breakout rooms, do screen sharing, and have large meetings.  These are the features I love most.  Also, I love Zoom's gallery view.  Great for seeing everyone on the screen at the same time.","I really wish there was greater flexibility in arranging video windows in gallery mode.  Why can't I drag and move windows to where I want them, resize them, and re-order them.  Especially on mobile, it would be great to be able to more easily reorder who appears on the first screen of gallery mode.  Also would be great to be able to have more than 4 people per screen on mobile.  If processing power is a problem, why not allow the option to decrease resolution to allow users to see more than 4 people at a time.",,More robust features and wider adoption of Zoom,,
408,409,“Great for work or chatting with friends and family!!”,Overall it has been really great experience just sucks that you have to pay for it.,Love this app because it allows me to be able to do my business work with meetings and running interviews so that way it still gives out all of the information.  It has also allowed me to video chat with my family who don't have an iPhone love this so much better than using Skype and you are able to video chat with multiple people all at once.,The down side to this is that it does cost money for you to run it for longer times.  For example if you don't pay for premium you are only allowed to use it for short amount of times of 45 minutes but other from that it is really great to use especially for business.,,Skype is very confusing to use and it didn't allow me to do as much as I could do with zoom.,,
409,410,“Easy video chatting”,"I would say that when you first sign on to a meetings it is frustrating. Names do not automatically appear, microphones do not automatically turn on, and sometimes microphones are not attached to the proper mic. However, for its core function it is perfect and never has issues while the app is running.","The most positive aspect of this technology is the ease of use. I feel as though anyone can figure this tech out. It now allows you to do more complex tasks that other enterprise level solutions use to do and what Zoom forgone for ease of use. But, they have now included break out rooms and more controls for admins. ",One of the features that I do not particularly like is the app download. I understand that this is great for metrics and KPI's on growth but for first time users especially those on a mobile device or tablet it is extremely frustrating for calls that need to happen in the moment. On a computer this is a quick 10s executable but on a phone its a whole charade. ,Join.Me,It was not performing at an enterprise level capacity. Not enough API.,,
410,411,“Extremely easy to use video conferencing tool”,I have used Zoom for both personal and professional uses (including telemedicine calls). The streaming and ease of use is phenomenal. ,"Zoom is the most user friendly and easy to use video conferencing platform I've ever used. To set up a call, all you have to do is send a link to the other person(s), and the video/chat becomes quickly available. During this time of many people working from home, it has become an indispensable tool for teams to communicate from remote locations. I have even heard it works seamlessly with up to 1,000 people on the same call! ","It is hard to find a downside to Zoom. I know clients who use the free version complain that they are not able to host large group calls, but the Business version that my company uses does not have this problem. The cost may be prohibitive for some (I'm unfamiliar with the price of these contracts), but it is extremely useful for any large organization. ",GoToMeeting,"It's not necessarily a switch for my company, but I have used it previously with other organizations. GoToMeeting is much more ""clunky"" in terms of how to set up and access a call. It requires a lot more steps than sending a simple link in the case of Zoom. ",,
411,412,“A must have for telepresence”,I work as a remote team member leading the product of a small tech startup. As such it's crucial for my team to feel like I'm as available as if I was physically in the office. Many gimmicky products have tried to fill this need but zoom rooms is the only product that have us what we needed.,"Very easy to use, affordable with a generous free trial and just the right mix of features for an always available telepresence. We use an ipad hooked up to a mac mini with a normal lcd monitor. My CEO only has to hit a single button and he has my live video feed up (I still have to accept the call but there's an option to let the feed start immediately if that's the sort of set up you need). It's the next best thing to being there. Audio and video quality and better than most other systems we've tried.","We were hoping to find a P2P system that was free. So the only thing negative I have to say about zoom is that it isn't free, which is a pretty minor complaint! The pricing structure is reasonable, especially if you just need one zoom room station.",,,Google Meet,"Zoom rooms was the only solution that didn't require buying more hardware to have a dedicated ""start video call"" button that made it super simple for the office station. My CEO doesn't have to think about how to call me up, he just hits a button on an iPad."
412,413,“Zoom”,"Zoom solves the issue of having to be in the same room as someone to get something accomplished. I'm able to demo products, share information through chat, all while sharing my camera to allow those on the other side to see my facial expressions. It makes problem solving customer issues much more simple than trying to decipher an email.","So simple to use. It allows users of all technical abilities to join a meeting, share video, chat, etc in an efficient manner. The screen sharing functionality is really easy to use and I use it daily to demo and show clients how to complete particular things with our product.

414,415,“Great communication tool”,"As a virtual business, this is my preferred mode of communication.  Clients can see me and I don't have to worry about international long distance charges.  I use it for consulting, training and troubleshooting with clients using screen sharing.","I love how I can quickly share a meeting link and participants can dial in or join from any device.  We can share our screens, have text chat and record the meeting.  It integrates with my calendar and online scheduler so when a prospect or client visits my website, they can easily setup a Zoom meeting with me.","There is a bit of a jump in price between the free and paid tiers, the webinar product is good but the poll questions don't work consistently across devices.  It's very annoying that Google sends me a security warning every single time I add a calendar event from a Zoom meeting email.",Google Meet,Zoom has more features,,
415,416,“Zoom for conferencing and screen sharing”,"Going with Zoom increased our meetings quality by 10x given the flawless audio quality and almost instant screen sharing. While it lacks at instant messaging, you can still use other tools that  do this better, like Skype.","We have looked at Zoom to replace Lync (now Skype for Business) that was having issues in the audio/video calls and screen sharing. It turned out to be much better, in terms of quality of sound (much less noise) and a whole lot better during screen sharing. We do this a lot in our meetings and the quality (response time) was unbelievable. It was quickly adopted by our users and we never looked back on other tools for conferencing and screen sharing.
","While Zoom is best at audio/video quality and screen sharing, it lacks behind at instant messaging. It is hard to believe that the company did not spend too many efforts in making this simple feature work. There are big issues when you try to chat with a fellow worker like not getting the messages, notifications are not there. If you start using the mobile app, the confusion  is even bigger. My advice is: don't use Zoom for instant messaging, we are still using Lync and Skype for that.",,,,

417,418,“Conecting the team in 4 different locations”,"Overall, our team has had only positive experiences using Zoom Video Conferencing. As mentioned, we have team members in different offices around Aus, NZ and Manila and using Zoom it helps us be able to connect with another and use it to our advantage. Whether it is a Work In Progress meeting, or a walkthrough of our processes or just general support as a staff needing help, Zoom makes it super easy and simple to connect and get the job done. 
A click of a button and you're in a meeting, and another click and you can invite any user you want. ","What i love about Zoom is that it is so easy to connect the digital team from multiple cities, sydney, melbourne and manila, in a simple click of the button. Being able to schedule meetings, send out invitation codes and easily coordinate digital team meetings helps make the team run a smooth sailing ship. 

One thing we love about this software is that it allows us to share screens with each other. When a team member is having a problem, a quick zoom call, screen share, and the problem is fixed. Integrating with a mobile and ipad app helps so much as you dont need to be on your computer to assist the team, or to attend a meeting. ","The only things that i think are holding back the software is that it consumes a lot of power when using it on a lap top or mobile device, its expected but make sure a charger is handy. I think it would be great if you have some controls over the picture. Sometimes i want to make my image brighter and it would be amazing if it can integrate that in the future. ",,,,

The product is great and does what it is meant to do, and it's easy for users to learn and has an intuitive design when it comes to its features. Overall, I would much prefer using Zoom vs. other video conferencing and collaboration tools out there. It interfaces great with other office applications, and issues are so uncommon I can't think of any.","Zoom continues to be the best working video conferencing tool I have used as a professional. It seems to always work fine compared to competitors that seem more buggy and users run into issues with accessing rooms and sharing screens. Zoom's design and features are the most intuitive and easy to use to use the service for what it was meant for.  Zoom makes it easy to set up meeting rooms with Outlook, as well as quickly send invite links for ad hoc meetings.

422,423,“Glimpse of Zoom Meetings ”,"I have been using this app for more than one year for video conferencing, conducting webinars, conducting society meeting and video calling with my friends. When I want to hold a meeting, I definitely use Zoom. Since it consumes less amount of internet data and has simple smooth interface. ","Both the mobile app and desktop app are easy to use. The prior knowledge of the app is not needed to start using this application. The buttons and Icons precisely and accurately shows the functions of them.
The screen sharing and recording options are very useful. the shared screen and recording of the meeting are clear(less background noise).
The upgraded version of Zoom has chatroom option where we can create channels for groups of people participating the meeting. Then, we can communicate with the participants, schedule the meeting and share the link there itself in the app.
There are meeting reactions(nonverbal feedbacks) which can be used in any kind of meeting whether it is professional of informal meeting.
Consumes less amount of internet data. Therefore, small internet data package is enough for a month.","The free version of Zoom allows only maximum 40 min meeting which has three participants or more.
That is all I can say as a negative point of Zoom Meetings.",,,,
423,424,“Intuitive Meeting Space”,"I appreciate Zoom and the gaps in business it has bridges. In many ways, it seems to have slingshot us forward into a world we 'should have been' operating within already. It became a connector when we could not connect physically. The software in its basic functionality is everything we need it to be. As Zoom expands its features to become a more robust software, I worry it's 'bread and butter' functionality may be compromised for future expansions. Overall, I am pleased with Zoom Meetings. Overall, it is my preferred meeting software. But certain upgrades leave me feeling uncomfortable with the direction of the software. I worry that I'm an effort to be all things to all, it may become nothing to most.","Zoom dominates the remote meeting space during the pandemic because simply put it is an intuitive software. Getting started, establishing a lead, sharing screens, documents, etc seem to be where I want them to be. Zoom's user friendliness makes it my number one meeting software ahead of its competitors. ","I believe Zoom to be ahead of its competitors. However, the price tag is enough to make an administrator weigh the pros & cons of Zoom's competitors against the company budget. For a moment, it felt all of my business was conducted over Zoom. I feel that I am using google meet as much as zoom these days. I'm curious if this is simply a product pricing issue. ",,,,

At this point, you will need several online teaching tools, but Zoom is the best choice. In the real-time class, many students log in and participate without any problems. I tested various products on the market with fellow teachers and students. Particularly when taking real-time classes, the introduction of obstacles is barely noticeable, and once the students are accustomed to it, the interface is very convenient. It can be very useful in that respect.","There are cases when teachers need to connect or support their colleagues, but at the moment, they face a lot of errors and technical difficulties. It should be supplemented in that aspect.",,,,"I have tried Google Meet, Webex, and MS Teams. The systems are all stable and there are no major differences.

As a member of the IT team, we enabled the ""Remote Support"" functionality, allowing us to send a request to a user during a meeting to share their screen, restart their computer, and more. This functionality expedites our ability to provide support to our users.","With the pace of updates it can be difficult to keep up when a version will become unsupported.

It's easy to connect and get started. Cameras and microphones seem to connect easily. It's easy to switch between them. Video and audio quality are generally good. The option to change or blur the background is also really nice. I think the chat function is also easy to use and see. On some of the other programs, it can be hard to find the chat or the chat gets lost in all the different windows you have to open.","It is too simple sometimes. I wish I could more easily control multiple cameras, such as one facing the speaker and another focusing on the audience. It would also be nice if you could add overlays, such as the speaker's name or the meeting's topic. I also wish it would be easier to send invitations to meetings.

438,439,“Digital Meetings Revolusionized”,Zoom has been such a great asset  to me and my organization especially at this period of our corporate existence with the presence of the Covid19 pandemic. We have held meetings we thought we could not hold and business has continued to grow. Thanks to the ingenuity of Zoom  ,"Zoom is so awesome in its conception. I like the ability of the Zoom  App to conference people in a virtual digital meetings with so much ease. Zoom became a messiah during and after the Covid19 pandemic and up till date. I joined my first zoom meeting during the lockdown in 2020. I was wondering what they had to offer. I was however, so impressed after the meeting because of the level of participation. Even  as a first time, it was great. I like those features like when you need to ask a question, you press a bottom to signify and everybody waits till you finish and your question is answered. Another feature i like is the ability to switch from video to audio or exiting the meeting at a point and joining later. You can even mute the app.  Zoom is almost like a physical meeting experience. It is an app worth trying by anybody with digital inclination and a desire for technological growth and improvement. Zoom is the meeting app of the future.","My biggest challenge with using the app is the audio connectivity. Sometimes you are disconnected or seem to be disconnected as a result of audio outage. This is most common while using mobile phone. I believe this aspect of the app can be improved to make it more user friendly. The interface between features should also be considered for ease of switching from one feature to the other. So far, Zoom is doing a great job. ",,,,

The recording function is also very useful, because I can record the videoconferences in case I cannot see it at that time.

The application is great on the Mac OS X, really big buttons make it simple and straightforward to host a web con quickly, with just 5 buttons, less is more definitely more.

It feels pretty effortless to both join and leave calls.","I don't like that when you join a web con, it some times goes full screen straight away. Now I have never looked into the configuration but that is most def one of the most annoying things about the application. It's also a bit tricky to check what settings are active on a web conference. For me - the 2 things I want to go when joining a meeting of 100+ participants is (a) Turn off my web camera (b) Mute my microphone and honestly it should be easier to do this on the app. Perhaps an incognito mode.

Zoom helped me do that.,"First, it is extremely simple to use even for small kids. The fact that the students can join the session simply by clicking on a link which can be sent to all students through one email made the task extremely simple and time saving. Another important feature of zoom that I loved was the Whiteboard feature.

Also, it was extremely easy to write, erase and point things on the screen using the annotations features making teaching very effective and easy.","There are not a lot of negative comments I could make about Zoom. The only issue that I could mention is when the video and audio got stuck due to poor connection. This again is more of an issue related to internet connection and less about the software itself.

I think that if you're looking for a way to communicate, inform or educate, through video, then Zoom should be your #1 pick.",The one thing that isn't always ideal is how sharing your screen during a Zoom call slows things down.

Screen sharing and presenting really improve the experience  and delivery of information since you are running the screen yourself and not relying on another person to run them (like with a PowerPoint).","People outside of our organization do not need a subscription to easily use the product/join meetings. It is simple for people at all levels of digital literacy to use, making it less intimidating and easy to connect. During COVID and while working remotely, this tool has been invaluable in helping us continue to run our institution and communicate internally and externally.   ","It can be difficult to adjust plans (ie. upgrading/downgrading your webinar plan capacity, billing issues, etc), as the chat help is very limited and emails take days (or longer) for a response. There is no toll free number for customer service. While basic use of the product is intuitive, some personalization options are not obvious and there is no way to find quick answers. This can be very frustrating in a time crunch.",,,,

You can even use it from your phone (some functionality is limited on a mobile device). ","The internet is full of ""virtual meeting"" software these days that its hard to pick which one to use. While I am merely a user of Zoom and have no involvement in the security or functions of it, I do use Zoom on a near-daily basis for both work and teaching young kids, and its one of these easiest systems to use for video chats/live meetings etc. 
Whether you are a grandparent connecting with your family on the other side of the country, or a member of the armed services trying to keep in touch with loved ones back home, or youre presenting something to a class or group of colleagues, Zoom makes it super easy to do just that and more.

Personally, we were able to connect with friends and family for a variety of reasons - including baby showers, birthday celebrations, and even an Irish Wake.","We needed a quick solution for video conferencing when the workforce went remote.

It has significantly decreased my need to travel to see clients and it has improved my ability to increase ""face time"" with them without the expense or time drain of actually traveling to their location. For that along, it is worth every penny!","Zoom is the most reliable and stable video conferencing service I have found. I've used Go to Meeting, Skype, and WebEx in the past and have found them both less reliable and more complicated from a user's perspective. Zoom makes video conferencing easy and the quality of the feed, sound, and chat are impressive.","While scheduling a meeting in Zoom is straight forward, its integration with other calendar platforms like Outlook can be a challenge. Sometimes it works well and other times the meeting web link doesn't appear on the calendar invite. I have also found that Zoom occasionally ""freezes"" on me if I am using it on public wifi or on a wifi connection I have never used before. I also find Skype to be easier to use for international calls since Zoom isn't as widely used outside of the US.",,,,

I never discovered a bug or a malfunctionsl (i did it few and few times for its similar). After that, how's easy to install it!!!! Quick and easy. And now, you're in! U got only 4 buttoms on the top!

512,513,“Temporary Solution Leads to Permanent Improvement ”,"Zoom Meetings filled what we believed to be a temporary void due to our inability to host quarterly board meetings during the COVID pandemic. We quickly realized that it could morph into a long term cost saving, productivity boosting solution. Our annual subscription cost is less than a quarter of what we budgeted for a single board meeting, including travel and lodging expenses for our members. Because of the drastic reduction in expenses, we are able to meet more frequently, accomplish more, and utilize saved funds for other endeavors. ","Our non profit board of directors is composed of individuals from multiple states and time zones. Per our bylaws, we must meet quarterly. Prior to COVID, this was a significant hurdle to handle the logistics of scheduling a date and time that fit 9 busy people's schedule. After the pandemic, it became an impossibility. Zoom gave us the tools to bypass the need for scheduling meetings around travel schedules and allowed us to continue business as usual throughout the pandemic. Moving forward, we have decided to maintain our virtual meetings indefinitely, because our board has discovered that Zoom leads to more productivity, more frequent meetings, and less cost to the organization due to no longer needing to cover travel, lodging, and meal expenses. ","The only drawback for us is that the lowest pricing tier above free contains significantly more options than we require. That being said, we would be willing to pay much more than we currently do due to the vast savings we have realized by eliminating a significant line item in our budget by not having members travel to in person meetings. ",,,,"Zoom gave us the feeling of being in a board meeting. Skype has worked wonders for us in the past when we needed to virtually include a single board member who was unable to travel, but Zoom is superior in our view when it comes to hosting an entirely virtual meeting.

513,514,“Better than Micososft Teams!!”,Great experience and great app for remote work. ,"Zoom has been an absolute life saver given the Covid-19 pandemic and having to work remotely. Unlike Teams, Zoom Meetings allows you to annotate, something not achievable with other platforms, such as Microsoft Teams. It's also very easy to use and can host very large audiences. This is critical for us, given the size of our organization. I also like that guests require a password to join, which prevents random and unauthorized persons from joining in. The quality of the video and audio is quite exceptional. The breakout rooms/sessions which allow for group activities/discussions is a very cool feature, especially when doing trainings and workshops. Other features such as screen sharing, screen recording, private chat rooms, polls to allow for voting, emoticons such as the raise your hand feature, and host controls are also a plus.

I personally use this for both school purposes like lectures and meetings at the same time if I just wanted to connect with my friends far from home. I hope the virtual background feature will improve soon because it is really my personal favourite especially when celebrating one's birthday, anniversary or conference. It is sad that some cannot use the virtual background because their gadgets doesn't have that one setting to change their background the same with what others have changed.  ","Through the use of Zoom Meetings, people are able to contact and connect with anyone and see their faces in real-time. It is very convenient in a way with just using our mobile phones, we are able to easily use the Zoom Meeting app anytime. We even use the Screen Sharing feature as a Videoke to sing or whenever we want to watch something together from the internet with the group members, friends and family. ","The Virtual Background. Don't get me wrong, I love that feature it is just that in some cases the background couldn't work. For example, I noticed that only those who have Apple products such as Macbook and iPad. The virtual background will work perfectly fine but if someone is using android or Microsoft products, the background won't work. It would have been fun if anyone can access that Virtual Background of the Zoom Meeting application even by just using our mobile phones.

Among all the apps that I have used, it is the one that works much better with many users at the same time.","One of the things that I don't like about this app is how confusing it is on the phone, the few times I used it there I came in with the microphone open and I didn't know how to turn it off, or it was hard for me to find how to activate the sound to listen to the call .

","This software offers so many great features for engagement and interactivity. Polling can be used to get participants to engage throughout the session. It can be used for games, to get responses from attendees or get a as pulse on how participants are feeling about the session. Also, the whiteboard allows the host to write or draw, and can even allow participants to add content as well. The whiteboard can be saved do that people can refer to it again later.  There's also an option to allow participants to join ahead of time, or to have them wait until the host admits them into the room.  Also, love the ability to have virtual backgrounds. ","Some of the features aren't intuitive and it may be difficult to set up and use breakout rooms when setting up teams ahead of time. With practice, it gets easier.

My job entails meeting with clients and team members on a daily basis, so we now had to look for a virtual way to meet, and Zoom allowed us to do just that. Our company usually uses Skype but we were told about Zoom and decided to try it out, and we are extremely happy we did. The video and audio quality was out of the world. Unlike Skype, we were able to see everyone across the entire screen instead of small windows for a max of 3 persons. This made communication a lot easier. The 'hands up' and 'clap' featured are excellent and very creative. I also loved the share screen option which made the meetings which required the reference of documents, quite simple and easy. 
We also used Zoom for several training exercises. Zoom did not make it seem as though there was a distance barrier. For instance, the breakout feature allowed us to still have group activity and exercise within the training, as we would usually do if we were in the same space. 
The recording feature also made it very easy to record and document our meetings and training sessions. Not to mention, the whiteboard feature was quite effective for brainstorming sessions. ",There should be more icons not just a clap and raise hand.

",Easy set-up and device agnostic. Client experience very strong. Video holds up well even under limited bandwidth.,"The cost of using it generally. But in Zoom's defense, this is an issue for many solo entrepreneurs that love the service but have a hard time justifying the cost. I sometimes felt the set-up for video presentations was  a little cumbersome. And I also thought the client meeting invite could be handled better and emailed right from the modal window instead of having to paste some copy in your email client.  ",GoToMeeting,We thought Zoom's quality and pricing were more sustainable.,Google Meet and Vectera,Our choice was ultimately about what was most compatible with our clients online.

I do think it is overall easier to use than a bluejeans, etc., but perhaps they drank too much post-IPO champagne and the quality control suffered a bit. ","Zoom was the darling of the 2019 IPO class and it was easy to see why.  Easy to use, easy to accommodate both video conferencing and telephone dial ins, easy to share screens, not a ton of connectivity problems","However, recently our conferences have had a lot of trouble. 1) someone inevitably doesn't have audio, and 2) dial in numbers mysteriously disappear. finally, use of persistent numbers is valuable, but if your meeting runs over and you have back to backs then all of a sudden there is confusion when the new meeting's attendees dial in and the first meeting hasn't finished yet.

Each day, we have a daily bid meeting with our staff and owners and we also discuss ongoing projects, job site visits, change orders, contracts, etc. With Zoom, all of our staff are able to connect from their computers or their phones or tablets and we are able to screen share and hold our entire meeting.

554,555,“Video conferencing by Zoom”,"For professional meetings, I have been using Skype, Zoom and GotoMeeting. But I found Zoom to be most convenient. Zoom provided free session for like 40 minutes. Then after that you have to reconnect. Their customer support is not great at the moment though. ","The best point of Zoom is that you can add hundreds of participants. This is so challenging to do on Skype. With so many participants, Zoom runs quite smoothly. Another differentiating point of this software is that instead of a user name, it has a meeting ID. So you can create a separate meeting ID for every meeting. There is one permanent ID and many temporary IDs. With temporary IDs, we can keep all the participants separate and private. They are never able to contact back till they are allowed to. Zoom has also been working smoothly on a mobile device even while driving. So that means, unlike Skype, it can work at a very low bandwidth.","The weak point of Zoom is that it can not work independently. In order to inform my colleagues for a meeting and other communication, first I have to send them a message by email or other chat programs. Then we connect through Zoom. This is little annoying. Another point is that Zoom also allows meeting recording. This process is quite straight forward. First it heats up my computer. Secondly it has multiple buttons to be pressed to start a video recording. But the good part is that at the end it does not produce a MP4 file too big. ",,,,

If you're thinking about using this app for meetings or client consultations you will not be disappointed!   Get it! Get it! Get it!",I rarely have issues with the app at all. The only thing I've noticed is that when I log in for a client meeting sometimes it will change my status to not available and I've had to reset that a couple times because my client wasn't able to connect with me until I did.

Zoom was doing very rapid development during covid as people pointed out issues and still gets regular updates to fix or improve.

I've found the cloud recorded meetings with audio transcripts very useful. Transcripts are not perfect, but they do a good enough job to be very useful.

Zoom is generally one of the few things that I rarely find myself complaining about. It does not have some of the more flashy features, but I can trust it to be working.","Audio seems to be very sensitive to low bandwidth users. I grew up using voice over dial-up and didn't have these kinds of issues. The service allows video to swamp the connection which destroys both audio and video.

583,584,"“Reliable, easy to use, feature rich - best solution I've used for remote meetings”","Working for a global company we need to touch base weekly or daily with team-mates in other offices. We use this solution frequently. It makes our meetings feel as accessible and authentic as possible, with few technical interruptions or hassles to deal with setting it up.","- Quality/reliability of video is very good (compared to e.g., Skype).
- It includes screen-share with handy options (if you are using multiple displays it lets you select which one to share).
- Outlook extension is available to easily schedule a Zoom meeting while you set the calendar event
- Easily pop-out extras like participant list, chat.
- Mobile version is well-designed for taking meetings while commuting.
- Recording option.","Only minor: 
- There seem to be lots of windows involved - usually I end up with a leftover browser window after starting the app, and if I jump from one meeting to another I have a few extra browser windows, some of them are ""post-meeting"". It would be great if this were streamlined. 
- A small annoyance, when screen-sharing, is that the hideaway drawer gets in your way when trying to switch tabs in your browser or anywhere at the top of your screen. I'd like to find a way to move that to another position.",,,,
584,585,“Very easy and second most widely used conferencing tool at work”,,"-Very reliable video conferencing. I mainly use for video chat, screen sharing and record conversations
Options are very easy to understand and use even for the beginners

-Easy to manage participants

-During brown bag sessions I can easily mute everyone to avoid unwanted disturbances

-Other features like 'Play Entry/Exit Chime' may sound simple things, but these alerts are very handy when you are muted and working on something and have forgotten you are signed in to the call

-Private messaging or message everyone is very useful and we use that feature when discussing on the talk or ask questions.

-I have used it to review documents with globally distributed family. 

-Desktop video clarity is amazing

-I have used Advanced sharing options where I can choose between sharing one or multiple participants and also able to control who can share.

-Their online help is very extensive and helpful for beginners
","Free version is available only for 40 min and logs out the users once the time is reached.
-Mobile version screenshare is not very impressive, I have had audio  and video clarity issues

-If I want to just take the zoom call from my phone for muting my laptop video, it was challenging to find the dial-in number. Would have been good to show the dial-in number when user logs in or joins conference.

-Need a way to hand over the meeting to another host

- A good to have feature where I can take screenshots and save them on my machine rather than recording entire session

The app has no delays or lag time which I absolutely love compared to other software tools. I also love that as a highly collaborative team we can jot down ideas within the software, take notes, and can share our screens and make updates on files and documents in real time. I also love that zoom gives you the option to share your desktop which allows recipients in your meeting to see everything you have going on or you can simply share the actual file you want to discuss which office a little more privacy.",The thing I like least about the software is that you have to check your waiting room/lobby frequently.

The feature that I really like about this software is that I can insert the background as well as add filters to help preserve the private space around me and make me more confident with my appearance.","Is an application that is very popular with all customers around the world. There is nothing I can say about Zoom at all. But besides that, there is also a small disadvantage of Zoom. It is the lag that often occurs with large meetings. This reduces the performance of the meeting a bit, but it is also very easy to fix with a strong wifi connection",,,,

590,591,“Zoom Helps Your World Grow”,"Zoom has been instrumental in keeping us connected, both on the business side and on the personal side. On the business side, we've been able to meet and screen prospective rental applicants prior to in-person showings, which we've incorporated as a permanent part of our business model going forward. We've also established whole new relationships with providers and customers outside of our ""in-person"" bubble through the use of Zoom, and deeply value how much our world has been able to grow as a result.","Zoom has made collaboration easy, especially in the Covid-19 era. In the last year, I've used Zoom to meet with accountants, lenders, folks I am mentoring and to screen tenants for rental openings. In other words, as a happy placebo for in-person meetings. I've also used Zoom to have game night with friends and catch-up with folks who are self-isolating, to have parent-teacher meetings and to attend memorial services. Zoom really fills a need, not just right now, but over time, and does video conferencing better and easier than its competitors. How? It's simply easier - faster, less cluttered, easy to launch, update and use. ","This is a minor issue, but despite multiple attempts and uninstalling the software a few times in entirety, I've been unable to successfully and permanently change my screen name on Zoom. It's a minor annoyance to have to change my name at the start of every Zoom meeting, and take a dive into help documentation again every few weeks in the hopes of a solution. It shouldn't be so hard to make a permanent change inside software.",,,,

It alows its users to conduct video conferencing, share files and collaborate. It offers a good audio and video quality due to its low data requirement. It allows simultaneous sharing among users.

It is available on all major operating systems like Windows, linux, IOS, Mac and android. it has different payment plans for different people according to their needs along with a free version. Its free version allows upto 100 participants in a single session while its full version allows upto 1000 participants.",The only shortcoming that I can think of in Zoom Meetings is that some of the features that are given un desktop version is not available in its smartphones version.,,,,
592,593,“Entrepreneur”,Many of my team members usually have problems that need practice in play and zoom has played that major role in making sure that I help those individuals.

That's useful for our participants.",It's a complete solution that provides granular control to admins and hosts. We manage hundreds of users each month via Zoom and it's a seamless experience given the features built in Zoom and the control it gives us to manage every aspect of a meeting or webinar.,"As a user it's pretty simple to use. As an admin, it will take a little longer to understand permissions, features, users, scheduling priviledges, and such.",,,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,Everyone was using Zoom and was familiar with it.

Sometimes with the person I freelance for they have a tough time remembering how to allow me to share the screen and it doesn't seem to be as easy on a Mac when they are the leader of the meeting.  Other than this little issue it is a great software that I never have issues with.,One of my favorite things is that others can actually call in with their phones and listen to the meeting.  It isn't restricted to a video call with the software. ,"I understand it is only in the free tier, but when you get kicked off when you go over 40 minutes and you only had like 2 more minutes to go.",,,Vectera,I use both for different things.  I bought lifetime of Vectera on Appsumo and it allows for continual rooms for certain meeting groups with saved files and other other things.  So if I need a room that is continuous I use Vectera.  The one huge thing that vectera does not allow is people to call in with a phone number.  There are many times I have to use Zoom as the customer needs to be in the meeting with the phone call as they don't have a webcam or mic for audio.  So it works extremely well for that.  Both are great platforms though.

It has also helped me to know the people who have attended the meeting by name. ,"Unlike other video conferencing platform, zoom allows the one who created the meeting admit the users who want to join anytime. Another thing I like about zoom is that you can quality of the videos, they are really perfect. Another thing is that it an open source software, you don't have to buy the software for you to use it unless if you want to increase the number of people in the meeting.  Lastly is the features it has that is chat, raise hand and even share screen help people in the meeting to be in order and interact effectively thereby understanding effectively.","It requires a stable and strong internet connection for you to use it, otherwise the internet access is poor then the video quality will be affected. Even if it has a free version, that free version is limited to a specific time that is 40 minutes otherwise if you want more time then it means you have to buy plans.

Only the person setting up the meeting must have a paid account for unlimited meeting time.","Zoom is very easy to use and makes it very accessible for anyone around the world to join meetings. I already preferred it over other programs, but the Pandemic has certainly boosted its popularity around the world. It makes doing calls with a large number of people very simple and I have never had connectivity issues on Zoom before since it also allows for people to call in if needed.","Zoom is great, but for groups 3+ it will cut off after 45 minutes on the free version.

While it isn't the same as being in the same room, we can conduct business without the hassle of travel, and it is more productive than a phone conversation. I have used other video meeting services. Some have better features and some worse. Zoom Meetings is a basic platform that is easy to use and easy for attendees to connect. ","The pandemic caused Zoom to be a common safe virtual gathering space. The platform is easy to use. You can easily switch camera on and off, or mute your audio. There are a couple of options for screen format to see everyone, or to highlight the person speaking. I also like the ease of copying a link.","I felt that sharing a link required a few extra steps. I could easily copy and paste into an email. However, the link doesn't always hyperlink. I have to do that manually in my email program. When attendees choose backgrounds, the depth perception is poor, and attendees tend to float in and out of their background. I also sometimes have poor audio/video quality.

Since the beginning, Zoom has been super lightweight and easy to use, and has diligently added new and innovative features. Even though it's ubiquitous now, they've never stopped improving and making teaching/meetings easy to schedule, join, and record.","There are a few features that are kind of opaque/impossible to access.

Many of our clients are afraid of their privacy being violated due to hacking problems in the past.

My primary use case for Zoom is to record remote podcasts, since it is not possible to have people in the studio directly. We utilize the isolated audio recording feature, so I can therefore go and mix down every participant individually after the call.","I love it overall, however if I could change anything it would be the option for higher quality audio.

621,622,“Zoom Pulls Through For Distance Learning!”,"Overall, Zoom has been a lifesaver with the switch to distance learning.  My students easily access my zoom room from any device with minimal issues.","Once the software is downloaded, Zoom is easy to set up and establish.  You can create repeatable events and everything copies over to your digital calendar, including links and passwords.  Set up of a Zoom Room can take a few minutes, especially exploring features such as the waiting room, chat on/off, video on/off, sound on/off, etc.  However, after using it on a daily basis, I am finding it quite seamless.  There is a record feature which makes it easy to share later on with those that couldn't make it to the session.","As with most products right now, Zoom is constantly making strides to adjust to the needs of its users.  The changes have come quickly, though, and it would be nice to see a little more customer support for all the options and changes that are happening.  Even with the ""waiting room"" feature, I am somewhat cautious about my students being in the room and me not able to see everything that goes on (private chats, etc) until after the meeting ends.",Google Meet,My district advised us to all be on the same platform,,

I found myself  traveling for business across south east Europe and hoping on and off calls. Came to light that compare to other options Zoom uses lower capacity of the wifi/internet bandwidth and performed way better than similar applications under ""duress""- yeah, I know,  you probably did not think of that but when video conferencing in a far removed locations or with limited battery life on your laptop this is significant edge.","I do understand the business model but the 40min limit on the free version can be a limitation, that why my meetings are 30min slots.",,cost and ease of use,,"cost,  ease of use, and performance "

The breakout rooms have made it easy for us to meet as a total group and then be able to break in small groups to solve problems or vision without tying up all the team.,"We find this product to be stable, easy to use and highly effective to both instructional meetings and conversational meetings. The software handles discussions well and the breakout rooms are wonderful. In our organization, we use the breakout rooms a lot for smaller committee meetings and then bringing the whole group together for further discussion and then bringing the total group back together for wrap up.","At this point, we are very satisfied.

Third party integrity to join the session by VoIP bridge is also very interesting. User interface is also user friendly, user using it first time can also understand it functionality easily. ","A must needed feature is Auto focus to mouse, when host is using large screen size and viewer is viewing it with 100% zoom on it's small screen he/she might can view the 75% screen only and when presenter move the mouse to other hidden portion it should automatically move to it on. Presenter mouse should provide the multiple type of highlighter.",,,,

- There are breakout room options that can easily be set up and modify even when these are ongoing. 
- Host and co-host assignation is simple.
- Useful whiteboard and features for annotation on screen-sharing included.
- Chat options are very flexible for participants and host to use to send private and all participant messages. 
- Wait room can be set so no one can access to a meeting without permission from host. ","The only flaw I have noticed (not sure if I can fix it) is that it won't let me allow kicked out participants to rejoin. It has happened to me that someone has a duplicate access, I removed one, and then if the other one losses connection, he cannot rejoin, so I need to create another one. ",,,,

635,636,“Teacher approved!”,"Collaboration, synchronous learning, digital competency. ","Teaching middle school students, I appreciate the ease of use of Zoom. There was a slight learning curve at the begining, but all of my students are able to independently utilize Zoom. I love the screen sharing option as I often share a presentation or information.

638,639,“Solid Video Conferencing Platform”,,"Zoom is extremely easy to use.  All of our staff have been able to easily set it up, join meetings, share screens during trainings or meetings, and overall video quality has been excellent compared to other products we have tried.  The recording feature is good for sharing meetings with staff who missed (versus having someone type up notes and share that around).  Easily runs on my iPhone or laptop with minimal to no issues.  Like the scheduling interface with Outlook.  Have had meetings with 40 participants and the software handled it very smoothly.  Strongly prefer this video conferencing platform over all the others I have used.","We only run the modest ""Pro"" level and I haven't stretched all the functions.  Would love a ""Teams"" like atmosphere where I can quickly call anyone logged in.  Tough to tell if occasional mic/sound issues are related to my tech or settings in Zoom.

I use it regularly for meetings, presentations, informal chats, and even virtual parties. The sound and image quality is great, and the virtual background and filters are great to ensure some privacy while working from home. Also, I love the fact that people can join the meetings via phone, which has been a life saver when I do not have internet access.","I wish Zoom Meetings had more configuration options for recording meetings. First, the default is that only the host can start a recording, which can be a problem when the host is not in a meeting but others still want to record it. Second, the host needs to end the meeting, save the recording, and manually share the recording to others. It would be great if Zoom could automatically send a link to download the recorded video to all attendees.",,,,
640,641,“Zoom is an adequate tool to get you around online conferencing”,"I've used zoom in both windows and linux, can't say it's performance is better in one or the other OS, and in our team consistency is key, sadly I can't say the same with zoom.

It's performance varies from ""adequate"" to ""really poor"" at any given day within the week, so I could fairly say it isn't that reliable, we have daily standups and most of them are in time-locked conference call, there are times that we'll have to wait for the members of our team because they're having troubles joining in the rooms, or while your project manager is talking suddenly you'll get disconnected, and I have to say we'd usually waste precious minutes because of it.

These nuisances is a huge thing for a company who depends on video calls in it's daily operation, and I just can't recommend zoom for anyone who wants a reliable service for that purpose.","* It is fairly easy to use, creation of rooms are like a snap of a finger and setup a meeting at the get go
* It being cross platform is a huge plus
* It is available in a multitude of operating system
* Their pricing is quite competitive compared to other products with similar services
* Does not eat a lot of RAM","* It can be glitchy at times, ie: ( you'll get disconnected while on the call, screenshare does not work, the audio device can't be detected )
* Often times it is slow, though I have a fairly good hardware, it performs poorly at times compared to it's competitors ",,,,
641,642,“To Be Used Beyond the Pandemic Era”,,"Zoom has managed to connect people not only at school but with the families.

642,643,“Better than Google Meets”,Overall definitely recommend.  We tried from UberConference and Google Meets and I prefer Zoom.,"Zoom is straightforward to use, allows custom branding if you're using it for external meetings, and takes less processing power than Google Meets.","Just a slight inconvenience - You have to approve people for them to join a meeting, which makes it easy to miss late arrivals.

Decent in terms of audio quality and video quality. ,"Extremely difficult to use in terms of user friendliness. For example, after you test your audio, you need to get out and then join the audio again. Clearly after testing audio, and it passes, I want to join the audio!

645,646,“Easy to set up meetings for multiple Directors”,The ease of setting up meetings and giving out the log in information is so simple with Zoom that it only takes me a minute to do so for our Directors.,I manage calendars for 3 different Directors in the office and Zoom is by far the easiest to use when it comes to scheduling and starting video calls.  Other platforms seem more difficult for people to log in which causes delays in meetings to start.  I never seem to have a problem with Zoom and log in instructions for others.,The only feature would be a way to split log in information to host and start meetings somehow between myself and another assistant without having to share passcodes.  ,,,Microsoft Teams,
646,647,“Best Webinar and Virtual Meeting Platform”,This has enabled our team to stay connected during the pandemic and continue to provide top level education to our members ,This is the most intuitive and user friendly platform available for webinars and virtual meetings in my opinion.

647,648,“Easier and Better tool of interaction !”,It was best. Being a Student I had used both Team and Zoom for my online sessions. We found zoom more effective not only me but my friends and teachers also as we all later shifted to complete zoom meetings.,"The functions added to it are well balanced to peoples who want to study or to those who want to host. One can have every function that he or she  needed for ideal lecture. The ease of operating and deployment makes Zoom easier and better. The most liked feature of this app was we can share screen and join meetings with just a click or touch through link.

648,649,“Top Notch”,,"Zoom performs exceptionally well in video conferences, home office settings and online classes - especially in comparison to other options out there. It is easy to set up, user-friendly both in terms of hosting and particilating. I would recommend both the free and the paid account options, depending on the scope of your endeavors.","I wanted to write security at first but, in fact, Zoom has come a long way since the previous years' hiccups.
I am perhaps most ill-at-ease with the automatic focus on the participant who speaks - on the one hand, this is something one can easily disable, on the other hand, it is not necessarily Zoom's fault that it sometimes picks up in background noise.",,,Google Meet and Microsoft Teams,"I first came across it when I signed up for a course online a few years back. I was amazed at how smoothly and efficiently it performed with over 50 participants in the same meeting, which at the time seemed like an impressive feat. Learning it can handle way more and with equally ease made the choice pretty straight forward. Note, though, that I am still using other platforms on occasion, such as Google Meet or Microsoft Teams, as many companies and individuals opt for these as their video conferencing tool of preference."
649,650,“Zoom - A remote working necessity”,"Generally zoom has become the standard in remote meetings-- though it has been used in the professional industry  for awhile it has suddenly exploded in popularity due to the pandemic.

Security has been upgraded and now with the various subaccount management, user management is easier.","- fast setup
- easy to install
- easy to manage 
- everyone is familiar with it

- price can be a bit expensive 
- zoom bombing isn't as fun as it sounds 
- everyone has zoom fatigue at this point ",,Skype was clunky to use. The interface and webinar feature was a bit hard for my users to adapt to. ,,"Again, skype was harder to my users to use and everyone was already so familiar with zoom that it was sort of a no brainer. "
650,651,“I think Zoom is still ahead of the competition”,"It's been really good. It meets all of our personal and business needs. The amount of features and settings you can change is incredible. We use it for our webinars, meetings, and personal activities. I like that when the internet connection is unstable, it adapts. I can't tell anything about the support and customer service because I've never had any issue. ","I love how robust the software and the mobile app are. The desktop software, in particular, has several controls (you can change almost any setting to meet your needs). The virtual background and filters are surprisingly good and a lot of fun, even when you don't have a green screen. It's full of features like polls, mute all, different view configurations, and a lot more. All these features put Zoom ahead of the competition; they are just trying to catch up.","The only issue I see is the layout of certain options: buttons like Chat, Mute/Unmute, Spotlight, Lower hand, and others need to be placed more intuitively. True, it has gotten way better in the desktop version but the mobile app still needs work. Also, why people need to activate the audio to start listening? There's a lot of not-techy people who get frustrated wondering why they can't listen to the conversation in place because Zoom decides to mute it by default. It doesn't make sense. True, you could go to settings and activate it for all future meetings but try to explain to your grandma how to do it and you'll understand what I mean.",,,,"In my opinion, competitors like Google Meet and GoToMeeting are just catching up now. Zoom is more powerful, more robust, and now safer than these alternatives."

The video calls with other co workers and having my own virtual conference room empowers my collaboration with my peers.
Remote work feels a little more human with video calls.
","I want to list 2 features I'd like to have:

1. I cannot copy messages from the chat in a conference call. This is important since some times people share resources like urls, answers to some technical questions or any kind of reference and I'd like to simply copy the content to save if for later reference, honestly I consider a copy/paste feature a basic one.

2. When I want to share the link to the ongoing video call I simply would like to always have that feature available in the main window so no need to navigate or few clicks to get it but a single click.",,,,

I couldn't get my job done effectively without it during these times!","Our team used to use WebEx, and school-wide we made the decision to switch to Zoom about 6 months before the pandemic. Since I have used both WebEx and Zoom heavily, I feel qualified to compare the two, and Zoom is much easier to use and has better features. Even the option for fun backgrounds was a touch that many would assume is not needed, but is lovely when used with specialized templates and branding for special occasions or for important external client calls.","As of right now, there are no real cons for me.",,,,
654,655,“Video chat made easy”,Zoom is the easiest way to video chat and be productive in the pandemic while working remotely.,"In the age of corona, Zooming has become its own verb. The platform's dominance spans work and personal life, which speaks to its quality and ease of implementation. Zoom makes it simple to see and hear employees and clients without leaving home. It's my go-to video software whether I'm chatting with a client or my parents.","There are some UI quirks that bug me. It should be easier to invite people to a new meeting on the fly. Some common features are buried in menus when they should be more prominent. Even the mute/unmute label looks contradictory. But once you're familiar with how it works, Zoom is pretty painless.",,,Google Meet,Zoom uses less processing power so my MacBook Air fan doesn't start up.
655,656,“What Meetings Look Like Now”,"Zoom has greatly simplified our transition into the digital work life. What used to be an excessively long email thread in the early days of COVID has now become a simple digital meeting.
I think we will continue to use zoom even when in-person meetings return to being the default, as we often have team members on the move that will be able to join us in important discussions no matter where they are.","Like many other companies, we have switched to holding virtual meetings, and we have chosen zoom as our primary interface. Zoom has every feature I could possibly need: the ability to share your screen, break up meetings into smaller groups, virtual backgrounds, warning you if you are muted, gallery view vs presenter view, chat room that can share files, and so on. I have joined zoom meetings both from mobile devices and on my computer and have enjoyed the flexibility this service allows for users in terms of devices and joining meetings on the go. In fact, Zoom has even added on new features in updates that I didn't think I needed, but really liked, such as expanding the emoji response options.
Overall an amazing program that has made our transition to digital meetings so much smoother.","I can find very little to nitpick with this software, but if I have to harp on something: I believe the in-meeting notification system could be more customizable. For example, allowing the user to toggle on pop-up notifications for the chat or something similar. We often use the chat on the side in our classes, and our professors often miss messages from students because the notifications are not very noticeable as they are also teaching.",,,,
656,657,“I AM INLOVE WITH THIS APP!”,My experience with this software has been a blast! Not only video and audio but there is also a section to input chat as well. I highly recommend this software especially in this pandemic where persons can interact virtually. ,The advantage about this app is that it allows you to connect with people all over the world by just clicking a link to join.,What I like least about this software is that it allows the host to makes other participants host or co-host.,Google Meet,Zoom is way user friendly and faster to use.,,
657,658,“Zoom review”,I am using Zoom twice per week to educate 89 kids.  It is working a lot smoother than I thought it would.,"Zoom makes it very easy to set up and lead educational classes.

I also can send a link to an interviewee that has never used this and they can be on super easily.,I love that I can not only share my screen with remote employees or interviewees but can also remotely take over their computer to troubleshoot issues.,There is not a whole lot I do not like but things can get confusing moving and entering into different rooms that you have made and scheduled.,,,Google Meet,Ease of use and integration
660,661,“Excelent software for video and audio meetings between multiple users”,Satisfactory since we switched from skype to this platform we haven´t had any problems with our communications.,It´s a very lightweith meeting software with all the desirable functions to stablish a video or audio meeting with a very good performance.,"With the last update, all our previous problems were covered, at this time we don´t have any problems to accomplish our meetings.",,"A lot of problems to stablish communications, it was a bit slow, sometimes it doesn´t detect the call request, when you are using both the desktop and the mobile device, it doesn´t show you the request in the computer.",,
661,662,“Zoom's the new standard”,"Zoom has easily taken over Skype's previous brand dominance. Where people once said ""Skype me"" they now say ""let's Zoom.""

662,663,“Amazing tool ”,"Overall, Zoom has been a useful tool for not only remote work and learning, but I have also used it to record videos of my computer screen with my video as a ""voiceover"", using the share screen option. It saves so much time rather than recording a video on my screen and a separate voiceover; and the video can be recorded locally on my computer which saves time and effort as well! This was a feature I did not expect! Comparatively Zoom is also much better value than similar software, in my opinion.","Like many people, I began using Zoom much more frequently during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I had used it a few times before that and I enjoyed how much more functionality it had over other video communication tools such as Microsoft Teams or Skype.","I would prefer if gallery view were the default view. I am not sure if this feature can be changed to default on the user's end; it seems that my default is always speaker view and I prefer gallery view. However, this is a minor detail and overall the functionality of Zoom outweighs this!",,,,

No other problems, it worksvery fine.",WebinarJam,,,"The software is very intuitive. For participants can also use it without having to install a program. So it can also be used on the laptop you have from your employer. The program uses remarkably little bandwidth. So it can be used and hosted almost anywhere. I've used it several times for more than 50 people. And that's just as easy as with 2 people. 
If I compare it to Whatsapp, GoToWebinar, Facebook, Teams, I prefer to work with Zoom. It's easy, always works, I have a lot of control and can see up to 49 people on one screen. That's relaxed working."
664,665,"“Zoom Just Works, Which Is What You Want”","Our teams are able to be really productive, holding both structured and impromptu video and audio calls with great ease.  We have continued to be extraordinarily productive, even with a team of developers all working remotely and not able to pop over to someone else's cubicle for advice.","The software is simple, includes great features, and most importantly, just *works*.  The last thing you really want is to have people fumbling around trying to connect to a conference, and that almost never happens.  The audio and video quality is higher than using similar products, and we have found that it uses less bandwidth and is liked more by our employees when performing remote video conferencing.  Additionally, we have integration with out GSuite to make it super stupid simple to instantly create conference rooms when making meeting invitations.","There have been some minor platform outages over the past few months, but honestly it has not been an issue for us.

You can access it by the app on your phone or by using your laptop/PC","What can I say Zoom has all the features I need to meet with my team in a weekly basis. I love that you can chat with individuals or the whole group while also being on video. It is great that you can see everyone in attendance and the being able to privatize the access is great to reduce hacking and unwanted attendees. I am also in love with the background features that let you change your background to things like the beach, or an office building, or the latest trending movie. Easy to use and customizable ",So far I have no cons with this software. It has made the transition to working from home easier especially the need to check in with students.

673,674,“Easy to Use Video Conferencing & Recording”,"I help organize a yearly conference in Denver, and we use Zoom for bi-weekly meetings in the 5 months leading up to the event. It allows the 10 organizers to get on the same page about the event, and plan our next steps.

I've also used it at a local Meetup to record presentations, both live (and chat with viewers in real-time), as well as save the recording to upload to the cloud later.","Zoom is easy to use. Once you run the setup and install the app on your machine, everything just works. When someone sends you a meeting request, just click the link and the app does the rest. Use your phone or computer for audio (computer has always worked well for me). Video quality is great. Almost no lag time.

Easily mute/unmute so your background noise doesn't interrupt the meeting. And I love how the chat feature lets you talk with just one person, or message the entire group.

You can also resize windows and the video auto-adjusts to fit as many people on the screen as possible. This allows you to work with other screens/apps as you still see video of the meeting participants.

I've also used it to record presentations, where we capture the presenters audio from their computer, as well as their screen. We save the video locally, and then upload it to YouTube or Vimeo a few days later.",There's not really anything that I didn't like about it. I can't remember ever having any connection issues or problems with meetings. I should note that I use the Mac app. I'm not sure how well the Windows app works.,,,,
674,675,“Zoom is a great solution for video conferencing”,Overall Zoom has become an irreparable part of our business. We use it weekly and it has provided the type of video conferencing solutions we need. ,"Zoom offers a great platform for video meetings. Aside from the convenience of having an app based (if you download and use their app) video platform, Zoom offers cloud recording and storage of all meetings, ability to share presentations with all attendees, and can even be used by larger groups to break attendees into smaller sub groups/meetings, called ""breakout rooms"" (if one were to need this feature). Overall Zoom is a robust platform that offers business, educational, and personal solutions for video conferencing.","There are only a few negatives for Zoom. First, it does take a little familiarizing to learn the platform. Secondly, it does require a fairly high bandwidth of WiFi, so any reduction in internet speed (unless you are using Ethernet) may cause issues with video or audio quality.

If I had to find something wrong, I do recall once or twice struggling to know what someone was seeing on their end when I had sent them a link to join my meeting and they couldn't figure out how to share their camera or microphone.","Zoom makes is super easy to meet online - just create a meeting room and send the link to your user(s). Within minutes, you can share desktops, cameras and microphones. What I like most is the simple interface and ease at which I can walk a new user through the process to get started.","What I like least about this software is the time limit, last I checked it was something like 40 minutes. So there IS a limit to how long you can stay on these meetings if you're using the free version. But for most meetings, this is plenty of time. The downside is that you can't use it for a 1-hour webinar, which was probably the intent - otherwise who would use the paid version?",Adobe Connect and Adobe Connect,,Adobe Connect and Adobe Connect,

2) Sharing content.  You never have to worry about accidentally sharing anything you don't want to; Zoom lets you pick a specific window to share and won't show other windows if you have to toggle to a chat, email, etc while presenting.","Connecting to meeting audio could be a bit more seamless; currently, you have to first connect to the meeting itself, and then choose whether to have Zoom call your phone, dial in yourself, or use computer audio.

If you are looking to use a certain software for video conferencing I would really recommend that you give Zoom a try.  ",I really like how easy and adaptable Zoom has been for my company.  We have switched back from other programs and found that Zoom works best for us.  It has a lot of features that other programs don't have.  Zoom has a more professional aspect about it and so it works really well when you are having business meetings with clients.  It is also nice that you are in a group room and you can send people invites to join the room.  You can choose to allow certain people to enter the room and kick people out of the room.  It also notifies you when someone new has joined the group room.  You can also take control of the screen of other peoples device and you can show the screen of your device to the room.  This is a very nice feature because it allows you to show people in the meeting certain digital things.  ,"I do not have a lot of cons about Zoom.  There have been a few times where the connection has been dropped or it has been hard to start a connection between certain people.  Also, I have found that if you get a large number of people in the room you can start to lag somewhat.  I have only noticed this a few different times.  ",,,,

","If you plan on conducting lengthy, business-critical video calls, or if client video/screensharing conferences are a major part of your daily routine, I would recommend doing robust internal testing before rolling this service out to clients. I have found that with longer conference sessions there tend to be more connection failures than is ideal, especially if you are recording the session. Also, keep in mind that client-side software is required to participate.

684,685,"“First day to use Zoom Video Conferencing, I'm hooked!”","I had my first video conferencing using Zoom today & it was unbelievable! The UI has large icons/buttons  that made it easy for me to quickly know where to click to mute myself, start my video, open the chat window and so much more. I loved how when the host shared the screen, all the participant windows shrunk to the side but we were still able to clearly see other without buffering or lag time. It was extremely seamless as the host moved from her video cam, to sharing her computer screen and then another attendee wanted to share her screen and just like that, without any delay, buffering, fumbling around trying to find what to click - her screen showed, again, no lag time or lost connection! This is now my favorite video conferencing tool! And I've used almost all of them, but this one is innovative and allowed for a productive meeting, while others I've used seem to have declined in usability over the years and too much time is wasted trying to resolve connection issues. Zoom Video Conferencing  video and audio quality was excellent, multiple audio options (call out, call me, computer audio), similar to the competitors.

Zoom's enhanced security features make it simple to open up meetings to the public without fear of unwelcome communication from attendees. We have been able to have panelists, share users' screens for presentations, lock the meeting for only a few people, and unmute/mute attendees during the meeting by using the webinar feature. The ability to add translators to translate live throughout the webinar has been the most beneficial feature. I like that it produces a secondary stream for viewers who wish to watch in a different language, and that Zoom even informs viewers that translation services are available! I highly recommend Zoom for anything meeting-related!","For our company, Zoom has been a life saver. A s the platform's popularity has grown, the developers have done an excellent job of adding security and feature enhancements. Zoom's webinar bundle allows you to live-stream events, which I particularly like. The ability to provide panelists their own unique log-in URL in advance is the best feature of the webinar package. This simplifies the procedure by eliminating the need to worry about user roles during the webinar.","Zoom has two flaws that I don't care for. Unfortunately, Zoom's Youtube streaming integration has been having issues. Zoom wrongly authenticates our account every time we attempt to transmit our live webinar to YouTube, which means there are a lot of hoops to run through simply to get signed in and live streaming to YouTube. The second slight annoyance with Zoom is that it automatically blocks the translators' email addresses with asterisks during the webinar. So, if I want to know who the webinar translator is, I need to go into settings and look for the email address associated with translation. I haven't been able to find a solution to have Zoom display the translator's first and last name instead of the filtered email address.",,,,

The responsiveness from their service team regarding security encryption issues was great. Zoom allowed us to provide group telehealth services for about 20 individuals for a very small cost. The breakout rooms are ideal for individual sessions, that allows the participants to easily rejoin the group session. ","During the time we were using the software, national attention was brought to security concerns. This was troubling but Zoom did a great job of responding to these concerns.

I have seen it mainly used by start ups who do not generally go for expensive video conferencing solution unlike big companies. And by people who want to have online classes during pandemic who found Zoom to be easy to use, quick to start with and cost effective. So pros would be,
- Ease of use
- Basic set of features essential to start off
- Cost/free usage","- Certain features are less intuitive for first time users. Eg., chat window does not dismiss on clicking outside but needs ""Close popup"" to be clicked
- Default audio/video options were a little hard to find out initially
- There is no option to pin a specific person's video
- A lot other features that MS Teams offers which makes it behave seamlessly as a chat and video conferencing client.",,,,

My favorite feature is sharing your screen, Zoom is my go to for sharing my screen for both business and personal reasons.

704,705,“The Best Digital Meeting Conference Room ”,"I use this software daily. Almost every business person has this software internationally, it connects with my Google calendar perfectly to schedule meetings at ease, and it's extremely rare to have a connection error. ","From the ability to start up a meeting in seconds, to scheduling a meeting with just a click, this is by far the greatest software for meetings I've ever used. ","There isn't anything to dislike. You can do it all, they have a ton of natural automatic log-ins for other softwares as well. I've honestly never had an issue with this software. ",GoToMeeting,"Just had too many issues with connections, price, and lack of support. ",,
705,706,“Easy in use but still a lot of features”,"Overall it is easy in use. I prefer it over Microsoft teams and Google meet.

Over MS teams: Ms teams is so much more than just a video call. If this is what you are looking for it is perfect but for me it has to load long for things I do not use.

Over Google meet: Google meet is perfect for a simple coffee call but lacks functions when given a workshop for example","When hosting a meeting it is ideal for clients to just open de link and join the session without any problems.

During meetings it is great to create ""break out"" rooms to split up the group. We mostly use this when giving workshops.

Screensharings works fast and most of the times clearly visible. Also the connection possibilities are fine even with a bit lower internet connection or with many poeple in the room",When sharing a screen you need to select an application you want to share. This part is fine. However when you want to change to another application it is not that easy and most of the times you have to stop sharing your screen and start sharing again with the correct application. This brings a small hussle arount it but still oke.,,,,
706,707,“Easier invites and notes”,"Zoom has let me run my business remotely during a pandemic, and I have been able to connect with friends and colleagues in a way I couldn't. I've used Zoom for work, school and social functions since the first lockdown. Some of the issues people have with Zoom, myself included, has to do with how adept other users, particularly meeting chairs or leaders, are at managing interactions. It's hard to do subtle things to call attention to yourself if you have a question, without interrupting a speaker's flow. People don't often notice the raise hand feature. ",The sound and video quality is generally pretty good when the users' internet connections are all good.,"I think there needs to be a notes feature so that users can take private notes about the meeting, not in the chat, and not having to switch back and forth with note software. 
I think there should be an easier invite mechanism.",,,,"Zoom is faster to set up, and more people have it. Skype's login process is problematic for longtime users who have separate MS Office and Skype logins because the login feature is now combined. It seems to me that Zoom doesn't even care if you're logged in."
707,708,"“Expensive, but the best software”","We meet with clients multiple times a day. COVID, of course, has made that difficult. Having a reliable remote learning tool, which allows smooth screen shares for presentations, is critical. Zoom has been a phenomenal solution, but certainly comes at a price. I would say modest in price. ","Zoom always works well for me. I've tried to find other solutions, but keep coming back to Zoom. It does require you have a good internet connection, but that's my only concern. ","It works 95% of the time. If I do have problems sharing my screen, etc. then I have to typically leave zoom and re-enter the meeting. It always solves the problem but is an annoyance.",Google Meet,,,
708,709,“Functionality is the Key”,"Initially, we did not think we would be a large platform video conferencing system.  We selected Zoom for its affordability and functionality.  It immediately became apparent that we would need access to a larger platform and Zoom customer service responded immediately with a solution that perfectly suited our needs at a reasonable upgrade price and flexibility.  After a brief learning curve, we were hosting events with several hundred participants without any major issues.","This software allows for easy transition from small project meetings to web-based seminars for 200 to webinars for 5000.  It has all of the features of more established products without their corporate feel.  It also provides time tracking for participants, which was essential for our primary purpose.",The only downside to Zoom is that it grew quickly and it's upgrade process was forever hampering the ability of users to be certain they had the most recent and compatible software.  This problem has been addressed and transitions to new versions have been much smoother.,,,Webex and GoToMeeting,It had the best pricing structure for what we assumed our needs would be and also the features that we most desired.

It helped us a lot in this  pandemic situation.","Zoom Meetings & Chat is so easy to handle. HD video and audio makes your virtual meetings more effective. Zoom supports  up to 1000 video participants and 49 videos on screen. Collaboration tools are great. Multiple participants can share their screen simultaneously. You can record your meetings.  Zoom ensure high security and protection. It has fun tools like reactions ,polls, music or video sharing, hand rising etc. Zoom Meetings & Chat avilable in every countries and you can use it both PC and mobile devices.",personally I don't find any cons and I never heard anything bad about Zoom Meetings & Chat.

710,711,“Zoom is the only place I conduct meetings!”,I love zoom meetings and recommend it to so many of my clients. ,The zoom meeting room provides so many helpful tools for a CEO.  I love the fact that I can record a meeting and send it to a client or someone I am training. ,I really love this software I just find it difficult when it upgrades without me being prepared and losing time with an appointment. ,,Skype didn't have all the extra tools that zoom provides for a business meeting. ,,
711,712,“Zoom does what its supposed to but...”,"Zoom is great for what it does and offers a free version that is very limited compared to the paid alternatives. Zoom allows for you to chat with your friends, meet with companies and go to classes but lacks the security options that should be standard in this technical day and age. All in all, if you're looking for a 30 min session thats free... pick up zoom, otherwise I would honestly recommend discord for lenghty chats. ","Zoom does exactly what its meant to do. There's video chatting, screen share, classroom breakouts for teachers or groups within groups etc. It can be used for many reasons and definitely trumps skype etc. 
The ui is reasonable but not the best to use but the learning curve is not steep at all. The call quality is usually solid as well. It's also really cool that it features a background option that does not require green screen to work effectively. Its the most attractive feature in my opinion.  ","Okay, so firstly I would likely choose discord over zoom. Don't get me wrong, zoom is not bad for what it is. In fact, it's great. But... it lacks in certain areas. For instance, security. A class can be hijacked by anyone with the password and code, which did happen to our class once or twice... whereas in discord there is the option to share a specific amount of entries. Another issue with zoom is the ui, specifically during screen sharing. It can be irritating to constantly have to move the box or panels that show up from zoom. It'd probably be better to minimize them totally if possible.  This one isn't a functional issue but more of a flavor issue. There is no dark mode yet. I'm not sure if they plan to implement one.

712,713,"“When virtual meetings are referred to Zooming, you know you got a great product!”","Overall, even with the little quirks, it's a great software, even the free version that helps with better communication, especially between remote offices. ","It's very simple to use and user friendly.  Even the most non-tech person can figure out how to log into a zoom meeting. I do like the ability to turn on and off your speakers/microphone and camera as needed, making it more convenient for each individuals circumstances. Pre-Covid, I used this very minimally, but have found myself using it even now that I am back to work.  With meetings it helps show things, share screens, etc... so it will definitely be a regular office tool from now on. ","It does take a strong internet connection to keep it smooth, so that is a draw back for me, due to my internet at home being weak, I often get disruptions or even disconnected at times.  Another con is I wish the setup process was a little more easier, there are so many settings that I feel need to be explained better as to whether or not I should turn on certain features or not. For instance, in a meeting where several of us needed to share screens, the host had that featured turned off and several of us were trying to figure it out and delayed our meeting quite a bit.  I would like to see certain questions ask to the host each time or you can choose to click default, but if you're not given the option at the beginning of each meeting, you forget to make those changes.

Zoom allows us to stay connected when distance is a factor in our business. ","Zoom is seriously one of the easiest meeting softwares I have ever used. When the pandemic hit, and we were scrambling to reorganize our business lives, this was the first thing we signed up for! It has been a lifesaver. It was extremely easy to set-up and even easier to start our first meeting. We now use it on a weekly basis. The features included have all met our needs. We can easily reassign the host of the meeting for screen sharing. I have chosen not to use a passcode to enter my meetings; however, it is very easy to get notified when someone is in my meeting room and with just a click, I can admit them into the meeting. Overall, I highly recommend this meeting software.",I haven't found anything that I don't like while using this software.

","It has been really challenging to switch from office to home and Zoom made it easier during Corona pandemic. We now use this app during each meeting. Besides multiple screen meetings, this app even tolerate and provide non stop service for meetings with 100 participants. I liked that very much.","Just one point, sometimes at meetings with multiple participants, 2 or 3 participants begin to speak, it is very hard to follow, because it opens each screens one by one. That is valid not for business meetings, but for online lessons.

The paid for versions are very nice when you have a large meeting happening.,Being able to connect with the team or anyone virtually is critical in these unprecedented times.

Chat features are also good because you can message privately a person you wanted to tap, also the waiting room is awesome, so you have time to prepare and manage everything before allowing them to enter. Lastly, I do love how you can maximize the noise and change your background, it looks formal and clean.","Recurring meeting: It's good if you can put the schedule in one place per lane, you can put (MyCode Meeting, meeting ID, Increments, and time) because when we schedule a recurring meeting it goes by the date, it looks messy for me since it is cut apart.

It would not be functional, if I wanted to meet with more than one other person, each on their own device or if I wanted to screen-share. But, my use of the free version is time-limited. ","The free version of Zoom has sufficient functionality for me to conduct my online practice. Zoom also seems to adapt best to low bandwidth. It is also easy to send invitations to clients since my e-mail account is integrated into the Zoom app. If not, you can easily cut and paste the link. ","Sending a meeting invitation to a client can be a bit cumbersome. It takes awhile to get to your e-mail program. If you are sending several/many, you only need to get there once. The free version does not grant the user a HIPAA ""business associate agreement."" When the Covid emergency is over, this agreement will be necessary and the free version will not be useable for clinical purposes.

- easy of use: it's relatively to do basic things on Zoom, like switching on or off a microphone and webcam, share your screen or use the chat

- virtual backgrounds: I like the idea of using a virtual background (even just blurring your normal background can be useful in some cases)

- mobile app: I can use Zoom everywhere, including on my phone 

- ease of recording and changing view: side-by-side, speaker-only or other views... you can change it to your preferred one with just a couple of clicks. And the same applies for recording.

Overall, Zoom is easy to use because Zoom's primary features are self-explanatory, such as the whiteboard, though finding and using different aspects within the features, such as using ""Annotate"", are more complex.

It's convenient too; running late? zoom on your cell phone, laptop, with video or without...there are so many ways to use it and customize it, it's insane. And of course Microsoft jumped on this tool immediately and purchased it from the developers who must be loaded by now! ","Let's face it, it's not like I ran out and said ""let me never meet in person again and only do Zoom meetings from now on"". Nope. Like most everyone I know that utilizes Zoom I was, more or less, forced into it once the country was locked down last year. Fortunately, it is so absolutely simple to set up, utilize and schedule meetings that I had no issues with it. initially. Two things that make this an extremely useful tool is that it is so easy to use. Either download the app from the Play store or iTunes or use the web version and download nothing. then you schedule your meeting, generate a meeting code and email them out to the attendees. Once received, all that needs to be done is click the link and whomever scheduled the meeting allows you in. You even have the option of using fun backgrounds like the Oval Office, the ocean or even a room that zombies are trying to break into. Again great tool but.....","ENOUGH of the Zoom meetings!! I cannot be the only person out there who is sick and tired of these by now. Obviously, this has nothing to to with the app itself but with 'isolation' of it all.

You are only allowed to have meeting for 40 minutes and it disconnects you automatically. It also has a storage limit in the zoom cloud because after sometime Zoom deletes all your meetings.

There is also an option to record the meeting and that can be so useful when important topics are being discussed during the meeting.,The only drawback of the software I have experienced is the requirement to pay after 40 mins.

779,780,“Zoom Meetings & Chat: Scalable & Unlimited Business Meetings”,"Overall, Zoom really enhanced our communications and optimized our organizational efficiency. It made life so much easier communicating in groups via video. I can only recommend Zoom Meetings for all these reasons. ","What I love with Zoom is that they does not offer a fix amount of meetings per month. We were thus able to host the number of meetings we find appropriate at the company and this led to better communication, coordination and team working. I also like the fact that the platform would automatically scale to accommodate an increasing number of people joining our video conferencing sessions. At last, I really like the reporting features, which gives us insightful information about the meeting and the attendees.

I recommend to the leaders of our Association and all agree to implement it. This software is AMAZING! Even though we are just a little in HQ but we have many members scattered around the globe. It was so exciting when the first time we use ZOOM for our International Missionary Meeting, we invite all representatives from many different countries in Europe, Asia, South East Asia, and Africa. I am so nervous because I understand that many of them are not technology savvy. What a wonderful APP is the ZOOM we all gone through the meeting smoothly with more than 25 people and everybody are happy and have no major problem at all! The voice is so clear and crispy, the screen quality is best, to do a presentation on powerpoint also excellent. We will definitely continue to use this APP in the future and recommend all the field worldwide to use it too. THANK YOU ZOOM!

I would happily recommend the software to most companies who are relatively technologically savvy for quick online video meetings.","- Easily accessible application for our agency (internally) and our clients (externally).
- When clients don't have an account, they are still able to join video meetings.
- The desktop application is quick and has a small file size.
- The Zoom phone application works really well. I haven't had any issues with it.
- Share screen (or screencasting) functionality works really well. Excellent for collaborating over video.","- Video on the desktop application often did not work on Apple iMac.
- Whilst Zoom is integrated with Google Calendar and other popular calendar suites, inviting users to a future zoom meeting and adding this to their calendar is more technical then it needs to be. A few of our staff still don't understand/don't bother with the 2-3 steps required.
- Generally inviting users to Zoom meetings should be made more streamlined.",,,,
784,785,“The best at what it does”,"With Zoom I'm saving time driving to meetings that I can have online, and I'm making phone conversations more personal by having them face-to-face. It's miles better than something like Skype or Google Hangouts because the people you're meeting don't need to have an account, they just hit the link and enter their display name. I've found call quality to be higher than most VOIP services I've tried - and it's carrying video too, so that must be some kind of magic they've invented. My calls/meetings never seem to break up or glitch. All in all, this is one of a handful of products I would struggle to go without.","My clients think I'm seriously professional when they get a link to a Zoom meeting instead of a phone number or a Skype username. What they don't realise is that Zoom is way easier for me than either of those methods. I can host any number of people in a meeting, I can record it on the cloud and locally, I can share my screen, mute people, or just chat face-to-face, all without any technical setup. My favourite feature is the recording, because it saves me having to take many notes. But private chat is another really helpful one when you're in a big call and just want to pick up on a point with one person.",I guess we were all rattled by the security problems Zoom had recently. I'm not aware of my webcam light ever coming on so I don't think I was affected. I don't want to have to stop using Zoom because it's a key part of my sales and project management process. So I'm glad that they seem to have fixed it.,,,,
785,786,“Best Platform for Meetings & Collaboration Opportunities ”,"We use Zoom meeting daily for Sales, Marketing  & Support. It is the life-blood of our organization. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to present or connect with their community. ","The customer services & support & training to troubleshoot issues is my favorite part. The system is brilliant to set up & present meetings & collaboration opportunities, yet my favorite part is the attention to detail for customer service & support. ","Unfortunately, technology does not always work 100% of the time. When technology goes down, all of our systems go down. At least the system does direct everyone to use phones for a conference call, if we cannot present through the computer or virtual meeting.  ",GoToMeeting,Great system. The system crashed too often. Not worth the value. ,,
786,787,“Great Conferencing Tool”,"Overall, Zoom makes it very easy to interact with our clients and then review the information again later. We also like being able to save recordings of calls, so that there's no confusion about what was said or not said.","The best part about Zoom is the ability to record, and you can even save your recordings to the cloud (automatically!). This made it very easy to conduct business, because any client feedback or sales call could be reviewed after the fact if we forgot what they said at the time. I especially like that I could set it to save the recordings automatically, because it took away the human error element if someone forgot to push the save button. It really prevents a lot of headaches!","Zoom is really great overall, but it can be confusing to use it as a team. It's possible that our team just didn't deploy it correctly, but we found it difficult to use a shared account, because the ""host"" name wouldn't change.

The best thing about zoom is it is very easy to use and you do not need any special training to start using the tool for the first time.
Best part of Zoom is its integration with Outlook which is outstanding. you can schedule call and meeting with the zoom as a normal outlook calendar.
","I am not sure about the cost parameter as we just use Zoom for calling prospective, but what I have experienced is zoom outlook made my Outlook getting crashed in order to get the issue resolved I have to disable the zoom add-in from Outlook and then suddenly after few days It started working fine, not sure if Zoom team have performed some kind of upgrades.",,,,
788,789,“Robust conference tool with lots of features”,"In our company we used join.me as a conference tool for quite a long time. Then our management decided to switch to zoom for some reason. I was very reluctant to do so because I was quite happy with join.me. (in fact, I was one of the last people to switch). When I started to use zoom finally, I didn't like it, as it looked so overcomplicated. All I need is audio and video calls, screen sharing, recording, being able to join from the phone - basically, that's it. Zoom offers all that - and much more, so I feel we are overpaying for lots of functionality we don't use. However, zoom does all I need and it does it good, so I can't complain here. Whenever I have a choice in the means of connecting with people, I always prefer zoom, because it provides better quality with less bandwidth, and that's the main point of the conference tool, I think.","* Easy use
* Good sound quality
* Live screen annotation during screen share","* You had to setup a meeting to allow other people to join, you can't just give them a link

I also love that I can record each meeting which I can refer to later on when I tend to forget about the topics that were discussed. It is free for up to 10 people conference, so any SME can use this software with ease.  Unless you will want to go advanced and embed your meeting room on a website, then you need to have some sort of technical skills, but their tech support is always ready to help.

Like i previously mentioned, this product has grown with demands pandemic has brought on, it has addressed the security and stability concerns raised around it, and is a staple, of not just my organisation, but all the other organisations and agencies I know. If this were a guitar pedal, i'd say the tone is awesome, the aesthetic is spartan and it's built like a tank, which really focuses the spotlight on the core of why zoom exists: so that we can see the faces of the people we talk to. Without them involuntarily pixelating. ","Being one of the fore-runners of efficient video calling and conferencing, it has had the opportunity to develop the platform's stability and security over several years, addressing user concerns and feedback. Everyone I know is on Zoom. So it has already become a top of mind brand name. With it comes the responsibility of the company to keep it secure, updated and ready to respond to the changes in today's needs. ","Zoom-fatigue is real. Mostly because a good number of our meetings are held over Zoom. But what largely contributes to it is the UI. It is effective and streamlined and very spartan, but i think repeated use of it, kinda makes one reach a saturation point in the visual aesthetic.

We hold prayer meetings as well with individuals in their homes participating.,"Set up and ease of use is superior to other products I have used in the past.

861,862,“Make virtual meeting like real with Zoom”,I have been using Zoom since very long for attending virtual class and meetings and I am absolutely loving it.,Zoom is very easy app to use. By clicking in a single link you can enjoy the whole meeting. The option it provides whether to mute or unmute the microphone during the meet is very praiseworthy. Also we can turn on or off the video on the need basis. The feature to accommodate the large number of participants in a single setting is its next strong aspect. During the meet we can also simply chat in a chat box when the meeting is going on. The next strong feature it provides is the meeting can be recorded for the  future use.,Sometimes when the virtual meeting is going on it automatically collapses and need to create a new link and start from there. This bug needs to be fixed soon. It will make  zoom more strong.,,,,

Additionally, I enjoy that you are able to see the individual that is speaking when you minimize the software to view something on your computer. ","What I like least about this software is the inability to share the screen for PowerPoint while still using presenter view. If you are the individual sharing screen you cannot use presenter view for your PowerPoint, rather you have to have notes handy. Additionally, if breakout rooms are utilized I was not able to assign responsibilities to other Zoom members until they came back into the main Zoom virtual room. ",,,,

866,867,"“Zoom, the king of videoconferences?”","To conclude, I think that Zoom Meetings is a great tool for videoconferences. I recommend it to students and to small businesses that had been ""home-officing"" due to the COVID pandemic. I also recommend you to check out Microsoft Teams or Google Meat for you to compare and decide which one is better for you.","It is free unless you want the premium version in order to unlock more benefits, but the free version is pretty great for most of the cases: Almost everyone is able to use this software, it is actually easy and basic. Its popularity has been growing since the last year, so it is common to find people who know how to properly use the software. Also, it has features such as recording the call, pinning up presenters, set backgrounds, sharing screens or whiteboards, etc.","Nowadays we have plenty of options to make videoconferences, the ""thing"" with Zoom Meetings is that the calls of more than two people only last 40 minutes unless you have the premium version which is not so cheap.",,,,Its popularity.
867,868,“Zoom's ease makes a good go-to for out-facing meeting”,"Zoom continues to be the best and simplest option for setting up quick and effective video conferences with participants outside of the company. As long as it retains that simplicity, it will remain a part of my work life.","Zoom's relatively simple interface is perhaps it's best feature. Over the last year or so, Zoom seems to have ironed out many of the kinks, and they've made simple common tasks like starting a meeting, conducting a meeting, screen sharing, etc. Zoom makes it easy to password protect meeting, and gives multiple simple ways to access a given meeting.
Another perk is, frankly, the relative ubiquity of the software. ""ZOOM"" has become fairly synonymous with ""video conference,"" and it's convenient that, at this stage of work-from-home or teleconferencing, that the mass training aspect of Zoom is basically behind us.
","Few complaints, really.  Zoom does all the essentials I need for it to do. It would be interesting for Zoom to experiment with alternate views of a given meetings participants. Sometimes the software struggles to assign a main speaker, especially background noise is a factor.

 I've also used Microsoft Teams, which has the advantage of integrating with company email addresses, calendars, etc... Teams is our first option for intra-company stuff, because of that integration. Zoom would be wise to find ways to do that as well.",,,,

It was different from our previous solutions and took some time to get used to but does seem to be the supirior product,Zoom accomplishes the normal features of video chat with key additional features like backgrounds and filters that make it fun and help to build relationships which is the primary thing that has been difficult with social distancing and stay at home orders,There are areas that take some getting used to.

881,882,“Zoom Review”,"Our experience has been exceptional and with little to no performance issues to report for our weekly virtual  staff meetings.     Granted, it is a small group of us (less than 10 participants), but the quality of the video and audio features has been more than acceptable... exceptional for us thus far with our experiences.     As my business (or for any business) grows,   upgrading our subscription with Zoom has great potential as it can further help us expand our business with customers, and to use the tool to serve an additional sales/marketing purpose here. ","As an Online Virtual Meeting tool,  we, to our pleasant surprise, found it not only easy to implement and use, but very inexpensive (free) to do so, especially for very small business owners requiring a remote virtual meeting tool to be used with remote 'on the road' employees(sales or technicians).       There is a paid version that may offer greater features and benefits if a greater need is necessary for any size business and those plans are very very reasonable in price.   An exceptional value.","For my business use, this have very little to 'not like'.       There may be performance issues if you do not meet  suggested bandwidth requirements but this is not necessarily a deficit with Zoom.

I have found it very helpful for staying in touch with family and friends from a distance and appreciated their  quick response when, early on, meetings were being interrupted by people outside the meeting group.  ","Once you get the hang of it, a Zoom meeting is very easy to set up.  I have had few issues with it that aren't usually related to a user error on my part.  They make meeting invitations easy to copy to send to other attendees and the quality of the calls is always good.  There have been no problems I can think of during my use since the pandemic started last March.  I really appreciate Zoom offering free meetings (time limited) but do have an account in order to have longer meetings when necessary.  I use Zoom socially rather than for business as I require a HIPAA compliant platform for work but Zoom is really great for connecting socially. ","I have no real complaints about Zoom.  I appreciate that they added a security upgrade in terms of asking for a password but I choose to not use that option since my calls are strictly social. I do have to carefully check or uncheck boxes use of a password, who gets audio/video, etc. when setting up a meeting but once you know what to look for, this is not a big deal.   It's also really easy, if you have a larger group, for people to talk over one another and this may take some kind of moderating by the host but again, not an insurmountable problem.  ",,,,

It can handle a large number of people and you allows turning on/off the cam and the microphone and also sharing your screen, as well as recording the session. It takes care of privacy too by having password for rooms","The chat, when in a conversation, is not very easy to use. Also, the number of ""reactions"" is very low, in my opinion, and I think that for conversations where there are many people, reactions are a good idea for quick feedback. For that, you'd need more reactions",,,,

And the outlook integration is a must.","They need to do an upgrade to the text chat portion. It's a little basic and could use a major update. Also to do more than basic settings you have to go into the web-based page to access them instead of client-side, and they're pretty numerous and unintuitively organized.

It is an essential tool for me when teaching remotely, and it is far more stable with better functionality than alternative video messaging products.","I don't like that I would need to have the paid version of Zoom in order to have the most security with my settings. With the free version, I am unable to exclude logins from outside our school district's domain. I do appreciate that the software is free, and I understand that the paid version needs to have more functionality than the free version in order for the company to make a profit.

I don't see that changing any time soon, even post-pandemic.","Prior to March 2020, I had used Zoom maybe once a month (maybe!). Since the onset of the pandemic, I have turned to this software at least once per day to engage with coworkers, clients, and everything in-between. Zoom has become the go-to platform for our work, and it continues to be a trustworthy, reliable platform. There are some deeper-level features that can really enhance your time with it, and I've become quite adept at navigating and using these features so our end users have little to no technical hiccups as they use it, themselves.","There was a light learning curve to figuring out where certain things live. For example, using Breakout Rooms requires a fair bit of playing around and tweaking before being able to host sessions with confidence, at least in my personal experience. Luckily, there is a wide variety of support content available online to pick up the ropes for newcomers.",,,,

Scheduling is so easy and being able to communicate and sync up with your team doesn't get much easier.  I haven't found a software comparable yet.,"There isn't a lot I don't like about Zoom, but one thing I like least about this software is solely the fact that you can't write on documents or edit together in the same suite, but your able to have something up at the same time and share screens which is just as easy. ",,,,Zoom was able to let me share screen as well as several other features that Skype doesn't come with.
948,949,“Zoom for Educators”,Zoom has been excellent to use as an educator and given the uncertain times has been something we can use as a constant to allow our students the chance to learn.,Zoom makes virtual teaching easy with the option to share screen and have private sessions to avoid intruders. It is easy to use and set up. I also like that educators have an unlimited session time while using Zoom. ,"When screen sharing, I cannot see the chat box as easily, or see people in the waiting room. I also would prefer various methods to sort out participants (e.g. by last name, by first name, etc). ",,,,Administrators at HBUHSD decided Zoom was superior for remote teaching.

It is annoying that you can't set default ""starting preferences"" because new meetings default to inconvenient features like passwords and waiting room.",,Slows down computer operations less,,
950,951,“The first option for Online Teaching”,,"I use Zoom for my online teaching, because of no directly meeting with students at school due to pandemic situations in my country. The school advised this software for their teachers. I can say I'm lack of knowledge using this software for teaching. But it is suprisingly that I finally can find that using Zoom for teaching is fun. Not only I can do the face to face meeting with my children, but I also can easily integrate my presentations that was made in another softwares, showing videos and even teaching alphabeths or numbers or drawing using the board feature there. ","When I used the recording feature in this software to record my conversations with about 10 parents, it was taken a quite long in terms of time , to have a complete all the recorded files from this software to my google drive. I must download another software to connect to the drive. It is easy and fast if I there is a way which I don't need to download another software only to put the recorded files to my drive. However, I rarely to use the recording feature, so it is not a problem anymore. ",,,,

The fact that its free is amazing to me as they could have truly taken advantage of a situation but choose to connect people instead. ,My daughters teachers use Zoom as a great way to interact and instruct the students as no one can be in class due tot he COVID crisis. The students seem to like the ability to still see their classmates during this time and the one on one lessons with the teachers are critical to those struggling.,There's the occasional bump out of a class and having to stop the whole session to invite back in the stragglers but I don't think at home schooling would have worked nearly as well without this.  ,Microsoft Teams,"I didn't exactly switch, I still use both but for different things. One is business and the other is Schooling. ",,

We are able to set up meeting to share our screens and break out into groups to discuss feedback.

It is great for meetings and virtual presentations and webinars. It could have better features in the free version.,Zoom is a very easy software for communication and it is the number one software that I have been using for work during this uncertain times. It is easy to hold meetings and make virtual presentations for people all over the world. I've been having meetings every day using this software and I like how easy it is to share my screen and use the annotation tools.,"With free account there's limitation of time if the meeting has three or more people. I know it is a feature to make you purchase the software membership, however the time limitation could be increased from 40 to 60 minutes. Also, for 1-1 meetings, only one can share the screen, and in order to make the other participant able to share the screen it is necessary to make the other participant the host, what gets confusing sometimes.",,Skype drains a lot of data from the internet connection. Zoom is lighter and the calls do not get interrupted.,,
954,955,“Zoom Meetings & Chat Keeps You Connected”,"We find it's one of the best pieces of communication software out there, not only for the price but from a  user friendly standpoint as well. Anyone looking to stay connected and hold meetings during these uncertain times I would highly recommend Zoom. ",Even before the Pandemic my team and I would use this software for both team and client meetings. This software allows me to extend my client reach no matter where in the world they are and still have a face to face meeting (virtually). Also gives companies the ability to be more efficient and collaborate amongst each other no matter where in the world they might be located. Highly recommend.,My only con would be that sometimes the audio and video might lag. But that's to be expected with technology  sometimes.,,,,Been a long time user and found it to be very user friendly.
955,956,"“Zoom, they're doing it right”","Overall I use this product to make calls, help clients, screenshare, and train our agents. This tools versatility is amazing. 10/10",This tool is great for many participant meetings. The software seamlessly handles major  meetings with over 100 users. The background customization are a must in the Covid working environment. ,The chat feature in room is a bit clunky and it would be preferable to see it in a separate window by default. ,GoToMeeting,The Zoom product was used by our sister company when we merged. ,,
956,957,"“Great meeting software, with great options and no lag”","Overall very happy with my experience, and my preferred video software for its consistently good performance.",I find that zoom is constantly a great experience with minimal lag. I also like the options to phone call in which has saed many meetings where the clients mic is acting up.,I dont like how many powerful features must be turned on in the web interface first. This means I didn't know how to create break out rooms until I googled it and prepared it before the meeting.,,Ease of clients to access,,
957,958,“Convenient and affordable meeting and videoconferencing service”,"I am part of a small team of 4 people who work on joint projects of which each one of us is the leader of each project, so it is necessary that we meet several times a week to discuss progress and resolve issues together, this This tool is used by the network expansion project unit to which I belong, it has been essential to be able to maintain effective communication and also evaluate and monitor the progress of each project and its interoperability with each team.","Currently there are many video conferencing services that have been developed on platforms that contain a large number and variety of functions, many of which provide sophisticated and in some cases advanced functionality, which includes screen sharing, interactive whiteboard, private chat, playback of video among many other features, although these functionalities allow clients to go beyond meetings and allow them to hold events or hold webinars, there are still companies that only require elementary functions for conducting meetings and in which any person can access without much knowledge, that is where Zoho Meeting comes in, which offers basic functionalities for small meetings and is that they offer a variety of options ranging from the free one in which you can hold a meeting with up to 5 people and payment plans ranging from $ 8 to $ 63 as needed.",Zoho Meeting is a tool which I use in the most practical and basic way and it has been fully functional since other services or similar tools were not as comfortable or simple as Zoho meeting,,,,
958,959,“Great for meetings away from the office!”,,"I can be at home, in my car, on vacation you name it and be connected to my other colleagues. And stay up to date on the daily news. We can see one an others face while talking or we can keep our faces turned off and just listen. So if you have horrible jet lag or bad hair you can stay invisible but still participate.",Nothing! It is the easiest one to use. I switched from another product that would show you exactly who is talking and made it hard to focus on listening to someone else.  Zoom is the best!,,Because Microsoft is a lower quality in my opinion and had less features to be able to make it your own.,,
959,960,“Great for Small or Large Groups”,"Our overall experience with Zoom has been very good.   Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that swept across the country, all of our regional travel has been eliminated or severely restricted.   Being able to get people together for group discussions and team meetings has been very easy and effective with Zoom.",By far the best feature of Zoom is that it is based online and accessed through your web browser.  The fact that we didn't have to get our IT department's review and blessing to install software really made this a great investment.,"Attendees using the Zoom platform can attend the meeting with computer audio or via telephone.  We have had problems being able to hear people who are using just computer audio.   Some of that problem relates to the position of the microphone on their laptop or PC, but we have had almost no problems with people watching on their computer monitor and doing audio via telephone/cell phone.",,,,"As a group, we had a discussion and a vote as to which software platform we liked better, the group chose Zoom."

Zoom doesn't generally make it simple to work out why you can't hear others or they can not hear you. besides that, it works incredible and isn't too difficult to even think about using.",,,,
962,963,“Zoom Rules!”,We use Zoom so much more in this last month with everyone working remotely.  It works well and helps keep us in touch.,"Zoom is so easy to use, even for novice users.

I've tried so many other video products, and Zoom is by far the best on a good or bad connection.","The UI is a little clunky, and at times it's hard to use. Sometimes I want to create a new meeting, or just get into a room with someone, and it's always a few more clicks than it should be.

964,965,“We're Zoom'n Now!”,"From the start, our rep [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN], was extremely supportive and guided us through the tier levels and what functionality was included in each.  We're a relatively small shop and definitely wanted to 'kick the tires' before making any decisions.  We seamlessly migrated from our trial period into production within a 3 week period.  A number of our customers were already using Zoom and we had firsthand experience of the quality and ease of use.  Compared to other products we had used in the past, Zoom was a definite upgrade at a lower price point.
","Prior to migrating to Zoom, we had several WebEx accounts with different pricing levels.  It was expensive and we started in incur quality issues.  Enter Zoom.  Not only was Zoom's pricing lower, but the quality of voice and data were phenomenal.  From an administrative perspective, it was extremely simple to set up users.  It was a no-brainer to switch.",The only knock on video conference products is that they do consume a lot of CPU resources.  You can't be running a lot of apps without incurring some degradation.  ,,Cost and quality.,,Zoom was the best alternative for us and provided the features we needed most and the best price.
965,966,“Best Tele-conferencing software around”,I have used this program daily as an online teacher. I find that it provides an instant space in the online setting to be able to immediately collaborate.,"I love the ability to see everyone's face in the space through their webcams. I have used this to monitor testing that occurs at home, to ensure that students are engaged through seeing their screens and also having them share their screens. The two-way screen share feature is perfect because not only can I help students resolve errors in their work in an online setting, but I can also take over their computer and show them how to do certain things, as well.","Honestly, I love everything about this software. What I like the least, I guess, is that I can only have one room open at a time. Having multiple rooms could be a good solution when co teaching with a teacher who doesn't have a Zoom account. Also, the accounts can be pricey, as much at $15.99 per month per user (not receiver, but presenter....users are free).",,,,
966,967,“The Most Convenient Conferencing Tool on Market”,I'm a big advocate for Zoom! There is nothing better than having a great product for an unbeatable price. ,"Zoom is by far my favorite conferencing tool I have used thus far and here's why: 
1) It's Free! Overhead in your office building can really add up so when you get a product that works well and is free, it's a huge blessing in the long run. 
2) It's already compatible with Gmail Calendar Invites. Having an option to add a Zoom Conference call to my calendar invite is beyond convenient for me and the individual(s) on the invite list.
3) Features are near-impossible to miss. It's all laid out in front of you.
4) Calling in for a conference room is Super easy! The directions are spoken and laid out for you on the computer prompts","The only error that I have encountered is a small glitch that happened once with a video connection.

967,968,“Happened By Accident But All Worth It!”,"It has helped my hiring when the software I've been using had issues and wouldn't get back up and working for another 72 hours.  Having found Zoom, not only do I use it for hiring but sometimes for internal chats with my colleagues as well.  Highly recommend!","So I've been using another software for awhile to conduct virtual interviews.  It just so happened that that software had issues for a day and, naturally, hiring doesn't stop due a tool that's not working.  I spent the day looking for options and lo and behold, Zoom Meetings and Chats!  I created an account solely for doing virtual interviews.  Candidates find it easy to use too since all they need to do is click on the link I send them.  They don't even to download an app.  So happy with this find that even my boss use it at times now too!","Because we're less than 40 employees at the moment, we are able to use the basic system and it works just fine for our needs.

There are things I do not like about Zoom, but nothing so major that it would stop me from using the program.",I do like that Zoom allows you to share your screen if you are working from a desktop. I like that you can mute yourself so that other participants can't hear you moving about,"I do not like that if your device isn't muted, every little cough will switch the focus from the person talking to your profile. I think there should be a 3-second delay. Also, the login process from an iPhone is terrible. I want to use the program without using the app and it will not allow me to do so. Very frustrating.",,It was what my clients chose to use.,,

I have not only used Zoom to conduct meetings but also to record video tutorials that I can share with the team. When we have client meetings the sharing screen option helps me greatly in showing them the insights and more information without actually having them to login to my system. The ability to record has saved us the trouble of repeating the meeting for a missed participant, or pester a colleague to update us on the missed meeting.",Zoom is an excellent tool for meetings. It is easy to log in and doesn't require any technical knowledge to have it setup. Zoom allows recording and also let's the other people know that the call is being recorded. The 'sharing screens' feature allows anyone in the meeting to share their screen to rest of the participants thus helping us do demos efficiently. The host having the ability to mute the participants when required also saves the hassle of unnecessary sound distractions from participants' environments. Every host has a permanent link which can be saved by the participants and used for meetings at any given time.

991,992,“I love Zoom!”,"We love Zoom Meetings! I was using it for meetings before the start of the pandemic but, since March 2020, it has become invaluable. I use it for work as a freelance paralegal, it lets me be able to meet with attorneys, meet with clients, schedule depositions, etc. with ease. I also sell Tupperware on the side and since we can't party in person yet, I have hosted successful Zoom Tupperware parties! ",I like the ease of use. I set up meetings and depositions for attorneys that I freelance for and the setup and execution is so intuitive. ,"What I actually like least isn't the software's fault, too many people don't know how to use it effectively and insist on either not muting themselves when they are in a noisy environment or not knowing they have to unmute in order to talk. It would be nice if there was a way for the software to know when you are talking and mute/unmute automatically.",,,Webex,
992,993,“Easiest Meeting Software”,"Zoom is easy to use, even for the users who are technology adverse.",Zoom is the easiest virtual meeting software out there. I have used several and this is by far the simplest to use.,"I like almost everything about Zoom. I don't love the additional features that are automatic of the waiting room and password. However, that is really easy to uncheck if needed when setting up the meeting.",Blackboard Collaborate,Blackboard was too hard for our users and it never seemed to work properly!,,
993,994,“Great for collaboration even out of the office”,"Definitely a positive experience! I think with everyone working alone right now, it's important to still feel connected with people. Whether it's for work or I'm on a Zoom call with friends and family, it's a great product that allows you to collaborate and not be alone.","I love the ease of being able to efficiently communicate with my team from anywhere. With all of us being remote, it's been important for everyone to still be able to collaborate and work together to produce great work. Zoom has helped us still feel like we can all work closely together and talk through any problems we might have for a project. They've also integrated great features like the Zoom backgrounds which adds fun to all team meetings.","There has been a few times where Zoom doesn't work well with my internet and I'll randomly be dropped from calls with no warning. It can be hard during presentations, but the tech support at my job was able to help me resolve it.",,,,
994,995,“Zoom is the bar for online meetings”,"Zoom has been a great tool for eliminating the need for physical presence during the pandemic. It's great for court appearances and depositions, as it allows us to share our screens and documents in a way that was previously more difficult. Other software may have better features, but Zoom keeps iterating and adding features to achieve parity or supplant those features","Zoom is almost ubiquitous now. It has been great for court appearances, depositions and mediations, and it makes it easer for us to interface with clients without having to travel or subject ourselves or our clients to unsafe environments. ","The Mac software is not optimized very well for dual monitors. It would also be nice to be able to cast the Zoom screen to a cast-enabled TV using a Mac, PC, or mobile device. ",,,,Zoom seems to be the product everyone is the most familiar with. Low bar to entry.
995,996,“Great tool for keeping communication lines open”,"The biggest problem that we have solved with integrating Zoom is getting our entire team together. The convenience of using Zoom wherever and whenever allows everyone's schedule to remain flexible, but we can all still effectively communicate with each other.","Zoom was incredibly easy to integrate into our existing systems. We were able to transition from on-site, in-person group meetings, to much safer, socially distanced meetings without missing a step! 

What I like most about Zoom is the capability to screen share. If I can pull up a chart, document, image or webpage, I can broadcast it to every member of the meeting and make references that everyone can see.
","The thing that I felt was lacking with Zoom is they seem to expect you to figure out all the features and functionality on your own. When we first implemented Zoom, we all had to feel our way through and figure it out. Some quick and simple training and walkthroughs would have been extremely appreciated.",,,Google Meet,It was much easier to use.
996,997,“Best Virtual Conference Software for the Masses”,"Overall zoom was really easy to deploy to our users and they felt comfortable using the software within a short period of time, which was especially helpful during the pandemic.","Having used plenty of different software offerings in the past such as WebEx and GoToMeeting, it's really incredible just how easy Zoom is to use. ","My issue with the zoom has been their security troubles over the past year or so, such as routing data through other countries and lying about end-to-end encryption.",,,,
997,998,"“Easy to use, popular platform. Inexpensive.”",I would totally recommend this to small organizations and everyone new to this world of web communication.,"Ease of use. Anyone can use it and don't need anybody's help.
Robust.
User friendly. Even kids use it.","Logo design could be made more fancy.
Sometimes the app crashes on my phone.
Can add more emojis and face filters.",,,,
998,999,“Zoom in 2020”,My overall experience has been great! Zoom has helped the world continue to go on through COVID-19. ,"This software has definitely become more popular during 2020, and it has been a great resource. Being that I have used Zoom for teaching, interviewing, and classes, I have extensive knowledge about its function and effectiveness. In many ways it has served as a great resource when teaching! I love the ability to assign breakout rooms, the hand raise button, the ability to share your screen with a whiteboard, and how many faces/videos you can see on one page in grid view. ","What I like least about Zoom is that it doesn't sync as well with calendars and navigating to different screens while screen sharing can be tricky (as it's very possible to show a screen you're not intending to show). If I didn't have the subscription through my school district, I do wonder about the individual costs associated with Zoom.",,,,
999,1000,“Perfect for current climate ”,It has been so easy to continue meeting with colleagues and clients despite being in a pandemic.  It is easy to implement and use both as an administrator and user. ,This video conferencing is perfect for the current remote climate.  It is very easy to set up a meeting and send to a client or coworker to ensure productivity. ,It would be nice if you could have more options for viewing when sharing the screen. Be able to pin individual users instead of just the speaker. ,,Price,,
